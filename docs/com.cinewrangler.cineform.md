## Description
<p>The <b>CineForm Loader/Saver</b> is a free (as in beer) loader and saver for CineForm compressed DPX files (aka. DPX-C) and CineForm encoded QuickTime movies.</p>

<p>The plugin allows to load and save 10bit YUV 4:2:2, 12bit RGB(A) and 12bit Bayer RAW files (load only) and supports all CineForm compression settings. Additionally it provides view selection (both, left or right) for Stereo 3D CineForm files.<br />
The DPX-C format is basically a DPX file containing an 1/8 size thumbnail image as 10bit RGB data. Hidden to normal DPX file readers it contains the CineForm data for the full-size image. Since it is a single-frame format, it can also be used on renderfarms.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>After installing this plugin Fusion will default to the CineForm saver for DPX and QuickTime when you create a new saver and just specify the filename with the corresponding extension. To save to regular DPX or QuickTime files (using Fusion's internal savers) you need to specify that format in the file format list.</i></p>
