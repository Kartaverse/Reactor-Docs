## Description
<h3>Follower In Time Text Macro</h3>
	
	<p>a Macro that allows you to create a Follower animation setup and then be able to scale that animation in time based on the number of characters your text has. Handy if you want a Follower animation to always have the same duration no matter how many (or few) characters the text input has. </p>
