## Description
<h3 align="center"><sup>&#91;se&#93;</sup>RollerCaster</h3><p align="center"><strong>Convert PDF to PNG and import to Fusion.</strong><br>Multi page PDFs will be made into a sequence of PNGs,
these will then be attached to individual ImagePlanes
and those ImagePlanes will be nicely arranged underneath one other to form a looooong credit roll.
You'll get an animated Camera as well...:-)<br>
The advantage is, that the credit roll could be layed out and edited in whatever app one prefers
(Word, OpenOffice, InDesign, Illustrator,...), exported as PDF and brought into Fusion right away,
with all the design goodies a credit roll designer might come up with.<br><br>

<strong>This Script does require a proper installation of ImageMagick and Ghostscript to convert the PDF to PNG(s).</strong><br><br>


Get ImageMagick:<br>
