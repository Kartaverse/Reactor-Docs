## Description
<p>Inspired by RedGiant's Haze (part of Supercomp) - use Haze to blend your foreground into the atmospheric perspective of the background with a heavily diffused background color. The Haze effect includes an optional shadow control to simulate the foreground layer blocking the background light that’s illuminating the haze. This shadow can be repositioned to match the light direction of the background footage, and especially helps the realism of backlit scenes.</p>
