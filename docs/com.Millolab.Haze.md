## Description
<p>Inspired by RedGiant's Haze (part of Supercomp) - use Haze to blend your foreground into the atmospheric perspective of the background with a heavily diffused background color. The Haze effect includes an optional shadow control to simulate the foreground layer blocking the background light thatâ€™s illuminating the haze. This shadow can be repositioned to match the light direction of the background footage, and especially helps the realism of backlit scenes.</p>
