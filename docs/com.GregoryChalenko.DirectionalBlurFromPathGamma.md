## Description
<p>This macro applies simplified motion blur calculating its power and direction from a path animation. Unlike the standard motion blur in Fusion, DirectionalBlurFromPath always produces straight blurring, not shaped to the animation path.</p>

<p>You can use 2D tracking data as the source of motion. It doesn't support zooming and rotation, but it's faster than optical flow based motion blur and in some cases produces better quality. Just connect the "Animated Offset" parameter to the center of your animated transform, tracker, expression etc.</p>
