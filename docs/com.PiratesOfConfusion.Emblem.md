## Description
<h2>Emblem WSL special</h2>

<p>A POC and WSL exclusive Episode has been released. What does it mean, WSL exclusive?</p>

<p>Well, many of you know that WSL and POC have a special bond going on. SecondMan, the Grand-wizard of WSL, has been a great contributor on our Discord channel. I felt that the only way I can contribute to WSL is by promoting the forum through my content.</p>

<p>Watch the special on We Suck Less!<br> <a href="https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=3629">https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=3629</a></p>

<p>Side note: The non-Fusion bits got longer than I wanted it to be ( you know I always try new things, Lighting, audio, camera, grading etc etc) . I promise the next episode will be more Fusion ( wink at Millolab :)</p>

<p>As always, thank you from the bottom of my heart,</p>

<p>Captain</p>
