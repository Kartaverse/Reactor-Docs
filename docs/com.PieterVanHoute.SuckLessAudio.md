## Description
<h2>Suck Less Audio Modifier</h2>
	
<p>A modifier Fuse that allows Fusion to read WAV (Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM audio files and modify parameters with them.</p>
<p>New since v2.0 is support for Point parameters, like the Center of a Tranform.<br>
Try using a soundfile to create a natural feeling camera shake, for example!</p>
<p>Version 2.5 brings many new features like dual sample slots for Point parameters. Now You can have two separate sample files for the X and Y axis.<br>
Individual X/Y channel operations allow for much greater flexibility to design natural motion paths derived from audio samples.</p>
<p>Suck Less Audio can now also modify existing animated parameters! Try adding a little natural jitter to motion paths, or any other parameter.<br>
You can insert Suck Less Audio after any other modifier!</p>
