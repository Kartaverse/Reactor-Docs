## Description
<p>The Light Editor script streamlines the process of editing light parameters in a Fusion 3D workspace based scene.</p>

<p>If a light is set to PassThrough mode then it is listed in the Tree view with a "disabled" shading tint for informational purposes. You can still edit the light's parameters and toggle its PassThrough state.</p>

<p>Requirements:<br>
Resolve/Fusion v16-19+ is required to use this script due to the use of icon resources in the ui.Tree list view.<br>
Python v3.6+ is required as well.</p>
