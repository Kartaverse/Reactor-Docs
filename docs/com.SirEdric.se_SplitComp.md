## Description
<h1 align="center"><sup>&#91;se&#93;</sup>SplitComp</h1>
	
<p align="center">Split the current comp into segments and send those segments to the default Render Manager.</p>

<p align="center">Especially helpful if you run into memory issues during rendering long comps. By splitting the comp into segments, Fusion is forced by the RenderManager to close and re-load the comp after a segment is finished, thus freeing memory.</p>
