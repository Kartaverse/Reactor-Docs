## Description
<p>The Plugin Scanner script creates a UI Manager tree view filled with the filename and filepath details for the Fusion .plugin files installed in your Fusion "Plugins:" PathMap folders.</p>

<p>The [x] Expand PathMaps checkbox at the top of the window allows you to see the filepath as a full absolute path, or as a relative PathMap location shortened down to a compact form. This is useful if you want to see in a quick glance if the plugin is coming from a certain "Plugins:" location.</p>

<p>The [x] Show Duplicate Plugin IDs checkbox at the top of the window filters the tree view contents so you only see plugins that have matching (duplicate) names. This makes it easy to see when you have multiple identical plugins installed regardless of what folder they are stored in on disk.</p>

<p>Single click on a row to copy the filepath to your clipboard. Double click on a row to open the containing folder. Scroll the Tree view horizontally to the right to see the extra columns</p>
