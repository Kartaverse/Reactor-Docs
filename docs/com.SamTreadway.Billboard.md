## Description
		<p>There are two macros included: "Billboard" and "Billboard-Large" </p>
		<p>These macros allow displaying a <strong>large</strong> thumbnail of</br>
		   your comp directly in the flow view. Place the macro/group inline in</br>
		   your flow or off to the side and it will render a large thumbnail of</br>
		   the input when the group or anything downstream is active in a viewer.</p>
		<p>Place these billboards at key areas around a complex comp and find your</br>
		   way around easily even when the flow is zoomed out.</p>
		<p>
			<ul><b>Features include:</b>
				<li>Manually update the billboard even when it is not en route to the viewer.</li>
				<li>Lock the thumbnail image to a specific frame.</li>
				<li>Add and position a text overlay.</li>
				<li>Paint over the thumbnail image -- it's a paint tool!</br>
				    (select the node within and send it to a viewer)</li>
				<li>As a solid color image (Background)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
