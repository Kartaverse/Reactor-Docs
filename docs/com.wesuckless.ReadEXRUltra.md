## Description
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The ReadEXR Ultra fuse is the tool to use if you just want Fusion to read in the damn EXR media at the location where you point the filename path towards. The fuse will hopefully never fail outside of its actual frame range. Well, it does all that. And... you can script its file input. FINALLY!</p>

<p>ReadEXR Ultra also supports the use of a <a href="https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=41165#p41165">Vonk data node</a> based text input connection to dynamically pass the image Filename.</p>
