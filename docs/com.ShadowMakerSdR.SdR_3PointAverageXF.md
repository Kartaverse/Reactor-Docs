## Description
This tool acts as a <strong>transform3D</strong> tool that averages the positions of the three Locators3D that can be dragged/dropped in the three source fields.<br> <br>
The sources don't have to be Locators3D, they can actually be any 3D tool that outputs its coordinates to the 3D world.<br>
This means that you can also use this tool to position an object between three other objects as well. <br>
But for positioning something on a plane, Locators3D are the way to go.<br><br> 
Version 2 now supports aligning objects to the virtual plane as well. <br><br>
Since the resulting orientation can be flipped depending on which order you select your points in, there are X/Y/Z controls to compensate for these misalignments.
