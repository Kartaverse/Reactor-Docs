## Description
<p>The "Open A Copy" menu creates a duplicate version of the current Fusion comp on disk and opens it up in a new tab in Fusion. This allows you to quickly experiment with another version of your comp in another view in Fusion will retaining the original that you can flip back to.</p>

<p>The Alt+O or Option+O hotkey can be used to run the "Open a Copy" command. Alternatively, you can use the "File &gt; Open a Copy" menu item.</p>

<p>When the copy is made, the file is automatically created with a unique filename. If the current comp was called "Example.comp" it would become "Example Copy.comp". If the destination filename already exists on disk then the filename is incremented to the next available unique filename like "Example Copy 2.comp", or "Example Copy 3.comp", etc...</p>
