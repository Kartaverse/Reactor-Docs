## Description
<p>This macro gives Fusion the useful ability to map colours from a gradient to an image, based on the luminance of that image. Other channels may be used, and optionally, Perlin noise can be used to perturb the gradient being applied.</p>

<p>It is based on a Bitmap Mask to extract the luminance of the image. This can be softened, or its levels can be tweaked, or a different source channel can be used (e.g. RGB, hue or saturation). The resulting mask is then given to a FastNoise tool and used to modify the brightness of the Perlin noise it creates. By default, Noise Detail is set to 0 (flat) so no noise is generated, and the image's mask is used directly. FastNoise's various colour gradient controls can then be used to map colours to the mask.</p>

<p>Tip: In some cases, you might want to preserve the luminance of the original image while just replacing the colours. This can be easily done by using bright colours, then using a Channel Booleans tool to multiply the result of the GradientMapper with the Luminance of its source.</p>
