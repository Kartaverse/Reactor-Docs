## Description
<p><font size=14><strong>SdR_VisualCrop</strong></font> is a tool that - what a surprise - helps you to crop images in a visual way, by using Viewport Controls to set the boundaries of the image you want to retain.</p>

<p>The added benefit to the builtin Crop tool is that no cropping will happen unless you want it to:</p>

<p>The original Crop tool will start cutting off image data immediately, so you can no longer see what's outside of the image, which is a pain if you overshoot. You can set up your Left/Right/Top/Bottom boundaries while the image remains in position.</p> 

<p>Its usage is hopefully self explanatory: Use the on-screen controls or the screw controls to set the image boundaries and use the Show Result button to apply what you have done. By default your cropped image will retain its position coordinates and resolution but if you want to, you can use the autocrop button, to cut off the parts you longer need. The reset button will restore the image to its original resolution</p>
