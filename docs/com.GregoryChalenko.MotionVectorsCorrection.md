## Description
<p>Lets you modify a motion vector map in case the position of your 3D-object is animated in 2D with tracking or other kind of 2D-animation to achieve correct resulting power and direction of the motion blur.</p>

<p>This tool should be applied directly to the motion vector map before its connection to a vector motion blurring tool (VectorMotionBlur or ReelSmart Motion Blur). Motion blur in the 2D transform tools which animates the position of your 3D object must be switched off to avoid a double motion blurring (vector-based + Fusion's 2D motion blur).</p>
