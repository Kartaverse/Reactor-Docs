## Description
<center><h2>Camera Sensor Database</h2></center>
<p>This script allows you to apply camera sensor information to BMD Fusion Studio based CameraTracker, LensDistort, Camera3D, uCamera, Renderer3D, and uRenderer nodes. The open-source camera sensor database project is community maintained, and is continously improving with more DCC package integrations on the way. The database supports new camera sensor submissions on the <a href="https://github.com/EmberLightVFX/Camera-Sensor-Database/issues/new/choose">GitHub issues page</a>.</p>

<h2>Online and Offline Usage</h2>
<p>When you have a new camera body to work with in production, the internet connected nature of this toolset means you won't have to repeatedly look up the values manually in the future, as additions can be submitted and synced to the database in record time. Also, the script caches the downloaded sensors.json data locally so it is possible to use the toolset 100% offline as well. This is great when you want to bring your Laptop to set and won't have a reliable internet connection.</p>
