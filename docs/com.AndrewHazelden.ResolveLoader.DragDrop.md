## Description
<p>The "DragDrop" file allows you to bypass using MediaIn nodes when importing images into the Resolve Fusion page Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Linux folder browsing window. The DragDrop Loader script is a quick way to bring content directly into your Resolve/Fusion composite. The DragDrop file supports dragging in multiple images at the same time, and each item will be imported into a separate Loader node.</p>
