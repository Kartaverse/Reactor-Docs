## Description
<p>"Atomizer DragDrop.fu" allows Fusion/Resolve v16+ to open up Reactor .atom packages for editing when the documents are dragged into the Nodes view from an Explorer/Finder/Nautilus based desktop folder browsing window. This aproach can help cut down the amount of time you spend navigating inside the Fusion filer picker dialog if you need to re-edit your atoms.</p>

<p>It's possible to drag several .atom files at the same time into the Nodes view and they will all be opened into unique "Atomizer Package Editor" windows. Note: <i>There is a slight issue with this multi-window editing approach in that the "Ctrl + W" hotkey doesn't track the current window.</i></p>


<h2>Where do I find the "Atomizer DragDrop" file in on disk?</h2>
<p>The "Atomizer DragDrop.fu" file is installed by Reactor to the local folder of:<br>
<a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Config/DragDrop/">Reactor:/Deploy/Config/DragDrop/</a></p>


<h2>Atomizer DragDrop Usage</h2>

<p>1. After you install the "Atomizer DragDrop" package in Reactor, you will need to restart the Fusion program once so the new .fu file is loaded during Fusion's startup phase.</p>

<p>2. Select an .atom file from an Explorer/Finder/Nautilus desktop folder browsing window.</p>

<p>3. Drag the .atom file to the Fusion Nodes view. The Reactor atom document will be opened up automatically in the "Atom Package Editor" window for editing and review.</p>
