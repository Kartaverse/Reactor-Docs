# Reactor Atom Packages

Reactor is a package manager for Fusion and Resolve. Reactor streamlines the installation of 3rd party content through the use of "Atom" packages that are synced automatically with a Git repository

Note: If you are running Resolve Free, keep in mind Resolve Free v19.0.3 is the final version of Resolve that is compatible with Reactor. Resolve Free v19.1 removed scripting access for GUIs like Reactor.
