## Description
<h2>Lens Flare Toolset for Fusion</h2>
	
	<p>included in the package:</p>
	
	<h3>Flare Circle</h3>

	<p>Draws a polygon or circle commonly found in lens flares. It can be positioned exactly and it has additional features like an outer border, variable softness and chromatic abberation. Use multiple FlareCircles connected to a main HotSpot tool to mimic real-life lensflares.</p>

	<h3>Flare Multi</h3>
	
	<p>Draws multiple circles with random radius, hue  and brightness. Instead of fading when the light source leaves the frame, the circles will vanish one after another. No need for tedious hand animation.</p>

	<h3>Flare Star</h3>
	
	<p>Draws the center of lens flares or star-shaped glints that can be positioned anywhere in your picture. The effect is meant to supplement Fusion's Hotspot tool and the FlareCircle Fuse.</p>
