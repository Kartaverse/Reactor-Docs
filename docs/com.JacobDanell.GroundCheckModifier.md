## Description
<div style="text-align: center"><strong>Ground Check Modifier</strong></div><br/>
<br/>
This modifier lets you easily place an object on an uneven ground.<br/>
Add the modifier to a position controller eg the Center controller in the transform node.<br/>
Connect the ground-image to the modifier and if the locator ends up under ground it will get pushed up to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
The angle is the direction the point will be pushed towards until it reaches the surface.<br/>
Search distance is the percentage of the resolution for the modifier to search for the ground plane.<br/>
If you have two surfaces above each other you might need to lower the search distance so the locator doesn't jump to the surface above.<br/>
