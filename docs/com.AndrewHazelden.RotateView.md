## Description
<p>The RotateView macro allows you to rotate an image in 90&deg; increments and at the same time it adjusts the image cropping to match. The node is handy when working with photos in Fusion where you have a well defined canvas size and aspect ratio you want to preserve while transforming the image orientation.</p>

<p>This macro was prepared as part of the Macro Building Essentials tutorial series on Steakunderwater:<br>
