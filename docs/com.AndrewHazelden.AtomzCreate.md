## Description
<p>The "Script &gt; Atomz &gt; AtomzCreate" menu converts a GitLab Reactor repository folder into individually zipped atomz packaged archives. The zipped packages are easier to use and manage with a NAS-based offline Reactor Package installation approach.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Python v3.6 to v3.10 64-bit</li>
	<li>Fusion Studio 16-19+ or Resolve 16-19+</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to provide feedback on the evolution of zipped Reactor Atomz Package workflows, please check out the <a href="https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=6115">development thread on the Steakunderwater forum</a>.</p>
