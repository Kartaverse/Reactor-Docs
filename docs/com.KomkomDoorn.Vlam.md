## Description
<h1>Vlam</h1>
<p>Vlam is an open source plugin for Fusion which creates weird and wonderful (pseudo) three-dimensional fractals. The plug-in is based on the original source code by Scott Draves (1993) and Andre B. Davidson (1999). It's open source, it's free, â€¦ and it can be terribly slow and beautiful. What more do you want?</p>
