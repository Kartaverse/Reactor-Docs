## Description
<h3 align="center"><sup>&#91;se&#93;</sup>Expressionist</h3><p align="center"><strong>Add or modify Expressions on multiple tools simultaneously.</strong>
<br>When doing MotionGraphics one often has to animate many (many!) tools,<br>
or connect certain Inputs of those tools to a designated Input of a master tool.
Sometimes one even needs incremental values, <br>so that Tool1 rotates twice as fast as the master tool,
Tool2 rotates three times the speed, Tool3 four times the speed, etc., you get the point...:-)<br>
A lot of copy & paste. And a lot of wasted time.<br><br>

This script adds Expressions to any Number of Tools and Inputs.<br>
Therefore it first checks the selected Tools for Inputs they have in Common.<br>
Those Inputs are then displayed in the treeview.<br><br>

To assign Expressions to an Input, first select the desired Input(s) in the treeview.<br>
Then type the actual Expression in the associated field.<br><br>
