## Description
<p>Vonk Ultra is a collection of data nodes for Blackmagic Design Resolve/Fusion. Vonk can be thought of as node-based modifiers that live in the flow. These node-based operations provide a no-code alternative to using expressions or custom scripts. Data nodes are tools that allow you to interconnect nodes together by supporting more data types for the input and output connections such as numbers, text, spreadsheets, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, metadata, arrays, matrices, and more.</p>

<p>These data node-based techniques encourage a more seamless interchange of information between DCC tools by reducing the loss of important metadata, removing manual data entry steps that can be error-prone, and keep data flowing through a pipeline in a more organized and consistent way.</p>

<p>The long-term hope of Vonk's developers is to help encourage artists and TDs to adopt "data node" concepts across a full production pipeline. These approaches are beneficial for teams working on cutting-edge projects in the motion graphics, VFX, XR, computer vision, machine learning, video/photogrammetry, and digital production/VP space.</p>

<p>Vonk's wide range of nodes include the newly added "vFileSystem" fuses which make it possible for a comp/pipeline TD to port the conceptual ideas found in a typical pipeline shell-script (.bat/.sh) into a fully node-based "Visual Shell Scripting'' paradigm that can run cross-platform inside of Resolve/Fusion/Fusion Render Node. This is effective if it's late at night, your brain focus is fading fast, and you need to quickly whip up in 15 minutes or less a general purpose data processing tool to solve an immediate production challenge.</p>
