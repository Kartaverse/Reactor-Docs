## Description
<p>This macro creates a procedural 3D model of an Australian Coopers brand beer cap. It is inspired by the classic Eyeon Fusion 6.4 era easter egg of a "Coopers" particle object. This CoopersShape3D macro is designed to be as a source input to your particle emitters so you can fill your Fusion 3D system based renderings with flying beer caps.</p>

<h2>CoopersShape3D Controls</h2>

<p>The "Cap Color" control allows you to select between the three offical Coopers colors of Red (Sparkling Ale), Yellow (Extra Stout), and Green (OPA).</p>

<p>The "Offset" controls allow you to XYZ translate the cap shape.</p>

<p>The "Rotation" controls allow you to XYZ rotate the cap shape.</p>

<p>The "Scale" controls allow you uniformly resize the cap shape.</p>
