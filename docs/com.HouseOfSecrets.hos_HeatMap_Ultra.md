## Description
<p>When you render a frame, each tool remembers the time it took to render (results may vary though per tool, situation or implementation). The hos_HeatMap_Ultra script allows you to colorize all (or the currently selected) tools to a hue/saturation ramp/gradient depending on the normalized render time of the tool. The script works with Fusion (Free) and Fusion Studio v7 - 9. It runs on Windows/Mac/Linux.</p>

<p>The script was created by Sven Neve at House of Secrets. The hos_HeatMap_Ultra version 0.2 release of the script includes contributions from Andrew Hazelden, and Cedric Duriau.</p>
