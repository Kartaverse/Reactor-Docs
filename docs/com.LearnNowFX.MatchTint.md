## Description
<h2><p> <font color="light blue">Match</font> <font color="red">Tint</font> | By Learn Now FX </p></h2>
<p>This tool maps the highlights of an input image to one color and the shadows to another.</p>
<br>This is Essentially the same as the "Tint" effect on After Effects.</br>
<br>This effect is especially useful when compositing pre-rendered elements into a shot.</br>
<br>And when compositing a keyed footage onto a background with a different color grade.<br>
