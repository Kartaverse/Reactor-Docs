## Description
<font color=#ffd100><h2>Blip</h2></font>

<p>Remember the last time you had to animate single frame events in your comp? Muzzle flashes, anyone? Flickering light bulbs? Lightning strikes? Glitchy motion graphics perhaps?</p>

<p>Simply do those little events by typing in the frames where you want them. Super fast, super easy. </p>

<h3>A quick rundown of the available paraneters:</h3>


<ul>
	<li><b>Rest Value</b>: the base value of your parameter. This is the value the Modifier will output on non-Blip Frames. </li>
	<li><b>Blip Value</b>: the value the Modifier outputs on the frames defined as Blip Frames. </li>
	<li><b>Blip Length</b>: doesn't have to be single frame Blips of course... </li>
	<li><b>Attack/Decay</b>: for Blips longer than single frames, you can fade them in or out.</li>
	<li><b>Blip Frames</b>: the frames where a Blip starts. You can type one frame per line, comma separate them, space, tab, up to you. You can be as sloppy as you damn well like!</li>
</ul>
