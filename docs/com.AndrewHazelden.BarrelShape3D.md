## Description
<p>BarrelShape3D is Fusion macro based remake of the classic Lightwave "Eagle in a Barrel" geometry (minus the eagle of course which should be connected to the "EagleSceneInput" input). In Lightwave this model was also known as "idiot.p" and it served a function similar to the Utah teapot model that existed in other 3D packages.</p>

<p>The BarrelShape3D macro is accessible under the Tools &gt; 3D &gt; BarrelShape3D menu item.</p>

<h3>Example Comp</h3>

<p>The "BarrelShape3D.comp" example comp creates a 4x4 grid of barrels. Their position is randomized slightly using the jitter control on the Duplicate3D nodes.</p>___
