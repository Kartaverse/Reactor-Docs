## Description
The Resolve Essentials atom package provides a collection of scripts, macros, and resources to help you get the most out of the Resolve Fusion page.

<h2>MediaOutUltra for Resolve</h2>
<p>The "MediaOutUltra" macro provides a way to render the Fusion comp to disk directly using the left or right viewer window graphics context. This allows you to bypass Resolve's Delivery module.</p>

<h2>FBXExporterUltra for Resolve</h2>
<p>The "FBXExporterUltra" macro provides a way to render FBX files to disk in the Fusion page.</p>

<h2>External Matte Saver for Resolve</h2>
<p>The "External Matte Saver" fuse has been updated to work with Resolve 15. This provides a way to export multiple alpha channels from the Fusion page. If you like the idea of the External Matte Saver fuse and want more control on the channels that are exported then you should check out the "LifeSaver" fuse in the Reactor "Tools &gt; IO" category.</p>

<h2>Hotkey Manager</h2>
<p>The "Hotkey Manager" comp script opens up a window that allows to you edit the active hotkeys in the Fusion page.</p>

<h2>Customize Toolbars</h2>
<p>The "Customize Toolbars" comp script opens a window that allows to you create a new Resolve toolbars. Using this interface you can add custom nodes to the toolbar so you can quickly access your favorite tools.</p>

<h2>Fusion PathMap Preferences</h2>
<p>The "Fusion PathMap Preferences" tool script provides single click access to the Fusion Preferences window that is used to adjust PathMap settings.</p>

<h2>Render Selected</h2>
<p>The Render Selected script will render the active node in Resolve's Fusion page Nodes view. This means you can still output content in Resolve's Fusion Page directly to disk using nodes like the FBXExporter node, or a custom EXRIO based Fuse.</p>

<h2>Open Containing Folder</h2>
<p>The Open Containing Folder script reads the active Nodes view selection and then opens a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus file browser window to show the containing folder that holds the selected media or ABC/FBX polygon meshes.</p>

<h2>Show Folder Menu</h2>
<p>The Show Folder menu allows you to quickly jump to the supporting folders used to store Fusion PathMap based resources.</p>

<h2>Resources Menu</h2>
<p>The Resources menu allows you to quickly jump to the supporting resources that are needed to maximise your use of the Resolve Fusion page.</p>
