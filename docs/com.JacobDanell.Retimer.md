## Description
<center><h2>Retimer + Retimer3D</h2></center>
<p>Retimer lets you retime your footage or 3D scene but it calculates the retiming on a frame basis.</p>

<br>This means that if you're on frame 100 and changes the speed from 1 to 2, the next frame will be 102 while if you would simply change the clips speed you would end up at frame 200.</br>

<p>The fuse contains three settings:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Nearest - The fuse gets the nearest whole frame</li>
	<li>Blend (for 2D images only) - If you end up at frame 10.5 you will get 50% of frame 10 and 50% of frame 11</li>
	<li>Subframe - If your footage contains subframes, this option will show these subframes. It does NOT generate subframes itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>For 2D images you can enable <strong><i>Show frame in metadata</i></strong> to add the current retimed frame in the metadata. You can later see this in your SubViewer.</p>
