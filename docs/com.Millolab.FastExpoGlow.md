## Description
<p>This macro, inspired by Stefan Ihringer's ExponentialGlow, was created as a faster version of the original one. A Fibonacci mode (thanks to Jacob Danell), Glow Only output and glow mask have been later added.</p>
<p>Lately I've been optimizing it for Fusion 16, and added the possibility to use new "Fast Gaussian Blur". Version 3 adds Highlight Rolloff controls based on a Joe Laude macro.</p>
