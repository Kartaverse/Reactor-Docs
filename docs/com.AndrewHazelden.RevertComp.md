## Description
<p>The "File &gt; Revert Comp" menu item closes the active Fusion Studio comp without saving it, then re-opens the comp again. This allows you to quickly do an experiment in Fusion, then flip back to the earlier document state.</p>
	
<p>Note: This menu item will not ask you to save the currently open composite document when closing it. If it did, then you wouldn't be able to revert to a prior saved version.</p>
