## Description
<p>Atomizer is a visual editing tool that simplifies the process of creating a Reactor "Atom" package. You can now bundle up your custom Fusion tools and assets in merge minutes and share them with your fellow Fusion users. Atomizer even supports adding a monetization option to your atom packages with the "Donation Amount" and "Donation URL" tags. This means so you can get paid for your hardwork via PayPal, or other payment methods.</p>

<h2>We Hope You Enjoy Atomizer!</h2>

<p>This script was designed to provide a feature rich user interface that would streamline the process of bundling up your Fusion content so it could be distrbuted quickly and efficently via the WSL forum's Reactor package manager tool.</p>

<h2>For More Information</h2>
<p>Check out the Reactor topics on the WSL Forum to get up to speed with atom creation workflows and techniques:<br>
