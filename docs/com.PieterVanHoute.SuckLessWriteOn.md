## Description
<font color=#ffd100><h2>Suck Less Write On</h2></font>

<p>In December 2019, We Suck Less was on Patreon for one whole year! And I wanted to mark the occasion with something to say thanks with, so I created a new <strong>Text Modifier Fuse</strong> called <strong>Suck Less Write On</strong>, of which you may have already seen a tiny little early prototype on WSL.</p>

<p>It does lines, words and characters separately, forward and backward, you can mute and solo each one. It does order-of-operations, and a few other nifty things that you should really discover for yourself. If  you're into titles, motion graphics, subtitles, lower thirds, text in  general or karaoke, SLWO is a must-have in your tool belt!</p>

<p>After installation, start Fusion, add a <strong>Text+</strong> node, right-click in the text field and select <strong>Suck Less Write On</strong>. Switch to the <strong>Modifiers</strong> tab and enjoy :)</p>
