## Description
<p>"Open in Script Editor.fu" creates a pair of "File &gt; Open Comp in Script Editor" and "File &gt; Open All Comps in Script Editor" menu entries in Fusion. This allows you to quickly tweak your comp file externally in a programmer's text editor so you could do raw "find and replace" editing operations, or to edit a node as code.</p>

<p>The menu entry will open your current Fusion composite document in the external script editor program that is defined in the Fusion Preferences "Global and Default Settings &gt; Script &gt; Editor Path" section.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Step 1. Install the "Open In Script Editor" atom package.</p>

<p>Step 2. Open the Fusion Preferences "Global and Default Settings &gt; Script &gt; Editor Path" section and select you favorite text editor. If you don't have a text editor installed yet, consider using BBEdit on MacOS, Notepad++ on Windows, and gedit on Linux.</p>

<p>Step 3. Restart Fusion so the menu entry is loaded.</p>

<h2>Note for Windows Users</h2>

<p>In Reactor's "Bin" category there is a "custom "Notepad++ for Fusion" atom which provides a very refined install of Notepad++ in a single click.</p>
