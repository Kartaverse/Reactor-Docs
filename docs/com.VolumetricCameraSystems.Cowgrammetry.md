## Description
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Volumetric Camera Systems is pleased to provide a *free* live-action captured Fusion volumetric 3D scene to explore with KartaVR v4 for Reactor. This example Fusion 9 comp provides a static 3D scene extracted from a live-action full motion 30 FPS volumetric mesh sequence experience that is known internally by VCS staff as "The Cowgrammetry MOOvie".</p>

<h2>Volumetric Capture Notes</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <i>The data in this demo has been reduced to 1/150th of its original captured resolution. For example, the barn model has been reduced from a high resolution 10 GB OBJ plygon mesh down to a 64 MB OBJ mesh to make it interactive in Fusion's 3D system, and fast to load on a wide variety of computers.</i></p>

<p>The "Cowgrammetry.comp" example has a scan of a old barn at a family run hobby farm located 30 minutes outside of Burnaby, B.C. Canada. This barn is home to Lima (Lee ma) the cow.</p>

<p>The barn was captured by Volumetric Camera Systems using a Leica LIDAR scannner to capture 3 laser scans and merge them into a finished point cloud of the barn envronment. Then the point cloud data was converted to a high resolution polygon mesh. For this Reactor downloadable demo, the barn scene and textures have been deicmated so they are interactive and fun to play with.</p>

<p>Lima the cow was captured by Volumetric Camera Systems' live-action portable "Multi Planar Grid Array" videogrammetry scanning system on Aug 2018 as a 30 FPS mesh sequence.</p>

<p>The human character in the cowgrammetry scene is a static mesh exported from a full-body 30 FPS mesh sequence scan of Tobias Chen, the founder of Volumetric Camera Systems. The character scan was captured using a "Planar Dome Grid Array" rig back at VCS's head quarters.</p>

<p>With Volumetric Camera Systems technology you can get high quality 30/60 FPS mesh sequences and point clouds from a portable volumetric capture stage that can be shipped anywhere on earth, run off battery power, and set up in half a day. All processing of "holographic" volumetric data coming from the portable capture stage rigs is done using a fully automated pipeline via Volumetric Camera Systems' hybrid CPU/GPU based compute cloud.</p>
