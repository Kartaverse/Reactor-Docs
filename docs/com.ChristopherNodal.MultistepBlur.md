## Description
<h3>Multistep Blur</h3>

<p>Built upon the BzMultistepBlur fuse by Gregory Chalenko and Roman Fedotov, Multistep Blur is useful when you want to create realistic complex blur or glow.</p>
<p>Blur and glow effects are built in several steps, with controls to tweak the diffusion bias.</p>
<p>Indispensible for photographic effects and much faster and more versatile than having to build the setup yourself with multiple blur or glow nodes.</p>
