## Description
<p>The VectorSnapshot script generates an SVG vector traced version of an image. This is handy if you want to convert a raster based rotoscoping mask back into a vector SVG image that you can import into Fusion.</p>

<p>Vector Snapshot is a comp script that can be accessed from Fusion's "Script&gt;Andrew Hazelden&gt;VectorSnapshot" menu. This script works on the imagery loaded in the left viewer window.</p>
