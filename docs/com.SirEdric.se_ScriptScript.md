## Description
<h1 align="center"><sup>&#91;se&#93;</sup>SrciptScript </h1> <h3 align="center"> Comp Script Framework</h3>
<p>Many times one has to do *really* simple things in script. Like setting all Loaders to postMultiply by Alpha.
Normally, this are just three lines like
<pre>if tool.PostMultiplyByAlpha then
tool.PostMultiplyByAlpha&#91;1&#93; = 1
end
</pre>
But to actually share stuff like that with a larger team, one has to write all that shizbang for comp:, toollist(), flow, maybe a Dialog, and of course an Undo event.
So instead of three lines you end up with 50.<br>
Now here comes ScriptScript into play.<br>
A home for all those snippets and small routines. Along with documentation for your co-workers.
You can keep the dialogue open on the second monitor, as it will always pick the current comp.
Large monster-scripts could be called externally from this dialogue as well, but primarily ScriptScript is for those nifty little every day tidbits.<br>
While this is still in Beta, development will go on.<br>
