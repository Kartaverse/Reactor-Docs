## Description
<center><h2>Flow Character Rigger</h2></center>
<pre>Make or Find a 2d Character. Split the character up into sections like:
<ul><li>Head</li>
<li>Body</li>
<li>Lower Right Arm</li>
<li>Upper Right Arm</li>
<li>Lower Left Arm</li>
<li>Upper Left Arm</li>
<li>ECT...</li></ul>
Connect your Layers, either as images or vectors. Now you can control the joint position and the Angle of the body part!

Watch <cite><a href="https://youtu.be/4QZ4M_wgY8Q">this video</a></cite> for an idea of how each part moves(body is different) and how to use the controls.
Also read <cite><a href="https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=6849">here</a></cite> for a deeper explanation on WSL.

This Macro is made with The New Macro Creator by Asher Roland as a test and proof that the exporter works :D
