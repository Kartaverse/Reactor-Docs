## Description
<p>The "Vonk vJSONFromFile DragDrop.fu" file allows you to import a .json file by dragging it into the Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Linux folder browsing window. This is a quick way to bring external data records into your Resolve/Fusion composite. The DragDrop file supports dragging in multiple JSON elements at the same time, and each item will be imported into a separate vJSONFromFile node.</p>
