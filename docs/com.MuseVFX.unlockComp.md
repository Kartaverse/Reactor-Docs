# Unlock Comp

## Description
<p>Sometimes a comp will be locked by a script process that fails to complete. When this happens, the Viewers become unresponsive, and it may appear as though Fusion has hung. If this happens more than once, the comp may have nested locked or unlocked flags. This script detects the current state of the comp and ensures that it is unlocked exactly once.</p>
