## Description
<p>If Fusion's file requester history contains invalid paths such as removable storage or disconnected network drives, it will hang for several seconds to a minute while waiting for the resources to appear every time you make a Loader or otherwise try to open a file. An excessively long File Requester history can also cause more general slow-downs, even if the paths are valid. This script clears all references to previously-accessed files from the global preferences.</p>
