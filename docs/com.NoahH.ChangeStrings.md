## Description
<strong>Change Strings</strong> is a Search and Replace Tool designed for Fusion. This can help you to quickly change selected Loader filepaths, increase versions, and stay organized. <a href="https://noahhaehnel.com/blog/manual-changestrings/">You can see it in action and read all about it here.</a>
 <br> <br>
This script can be used to <strong>batch replace</strong> strings (text) in:

<ul>
	<li>Loader, Saver, and FBX/Alembic Filepaths</li>
	<li>Node Names</li>
	<li>Expressions</li>
	<li>Text+/Text3D</li>
</ul>
It also contains many more features. Including:

<ul>
	<li>Increase or Decrease Versions</li>
	<li>Switch Text Patterns around (enable Space Splitter)</li>
	<li>QuickSelect Buttons for Loaders, Savers, FBX/ABC tools</li>
	<li>QuickSelect by Search</li>
	<li>A Textbox to use Change Strings for Text from outside of Fusion</li>
	<li>A proven UI with many Quality of Life enhancements</li>
</ul>
