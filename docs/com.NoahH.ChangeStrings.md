## Description
<strong>Change Strings</strong> is a Search and Replace Tool designed for Fusion. This can help you to quickly change selected filepaths, increase versions, and stay organized. <a href="https://noahhaehnel.com/blog/manual-changestrings/">See it in action and read about it here.</a>

This tool can be used to <strong>batch</strong> replace strings (text) in:

<ul>
<li>All file path inputs on all selected nodes</li>
<li>Node Names</li>
<li>Expressions</li>
<li>StyledText (Text+, Text3D, MultiText)</li>
<li>Any other text Inputs (including CUstom Tools, Layer Muxer, Render Scripts)</li>
</ul>

It is also packed with more features to make your life easier:

<ul>
<li>Simple Version increases and decreases (Versioning Tab)</li>
<li>Add Prefixes or Postfixes, version by the current date and more using dynamic Variables (%all, %toolName, %date2Y...)</li>
<li>QuickSelect Buttons</li>
<li>Toolbox tab for quick script launching</li>
<li>Including a relatify paths script</li>
</ul>

Any isues, feature requests or other messages can be reported to me by contacting me through any of the channels listed on my <a href="https://noahhaehnel.com/">website.</a> I hope this script saves you as much time as it has saved me.
