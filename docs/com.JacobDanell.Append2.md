## Description
<center><h2>Append 2</h2></center>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Connect up to 64 shots and append them after each other.</li>
	<li>Fade between shots</li>
	<li> Loop infinitely</li>
</ul>

<p>A new version of my Append fuse! This time it works as a tool instead of a generator.</p>

<br>The nodes length of time is now also being changed correctly using SetRegion added to fuses in F18.1, so Append 2 only works in F18.1+</br>

<p>Append multiple clips one after each other with this fuse.</p>

<br>Connect them in the order of playback and the fuse does what you expect it to do!</br>
<br>This fuse also lets you blend between the connected nodes by the blend sliders and also loop them with ease.</br>
