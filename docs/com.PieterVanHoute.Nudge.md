## Description
<h2 align="center">Nudge</h2>
	<p>Nudge is a very simple warp tool, that displaces pixels from a source point to a target point, within a user definable range.</p>
	<p>When using a series of Nudges, they can be concatenated, i.e. the image will be warped only once to get the result, no matter how many Nudges you use.</p>
