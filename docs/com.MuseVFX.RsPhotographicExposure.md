## Description
<p>RsPhotographicExposure emulates the Photographic Exposure controls on the Redshift camera. It allows a compositor to easily match the results of the baked-in exposure adjustments using either slider controls or the metadata carried in the EXR. </p>

<p>In addition to Redshift's own tone mapping method, the macro also includes John Hable's Filmic Tone Mapping, as used for the video game Uncharted 2, a Highlight Compression mode similar to that performed by the Corona render engine, and an Exponential Luma mode that clamps luminance while preserving hue.</p>

<p>Find it with the Color tools.</p>

<p>v2: Fixed an error that occurs when multiple copies of the macro are present in the same comp.</p>
