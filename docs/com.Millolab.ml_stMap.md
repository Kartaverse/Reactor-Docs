## Description
<p>Fusion rendition of stMap node in Nuke. HOW IT WORKS: in the BG goes what you want to be distorted and in the FG the UVMap to distort with. Remember to set the resolution in the Image Tab identical to the resolution of your composition, otherwise the macro won't work correctly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcPMCSikobw">Hop to YouTube</a> for a quick tutorial.</p>
