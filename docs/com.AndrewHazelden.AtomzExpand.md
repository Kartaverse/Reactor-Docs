## Description
<p>The "Atomz Expand" script allows you to import zipped Reactor Atomz Packages by dragging them into the Fusion Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Linux folder browsing window.</p>

<p>The DragDrop file supports dragging in multiple zip elements at the same time, and each item will be imported. This allows for easier NAS-based offline Reactor installation use.</p>

<p>You also have the option of importing Atomz package list files (atomz.lst). An atomz list text file works with an IFL image-file-list like document that is stored in the same folder as a collection of atomz zip files. The list is just a text file with a single package name per line that has the .lst file extension added to the filename. Using lst files let you define a custom selection list of packages to be installed at once. This technique can help with bootstrapping a local set of zipped offline usable Atomz packages in a bundle that get bulk loaded in fast.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Python v3.6 to v3.10 64-bit</li>
	<li>Fusion Studio 16-19+ or Resolve 16-19+</li>
</ul>
