## Description
<p>This macro generates a vector shape based teapot mask image that captures the likeness of a "Utah Teapot" from a profile side viewing angle. The macro is inspired by the classic Teapot alpha masking node that was an easter egg in early pre-2000 era versions of Eyeon Digital Fusion.</p>

<p>The Teapot mask has a native aspect ratio of 16:9 to line up with an HD or UHD frame size. All of the common mask GUI controls are available like Levels, Soft Edge, Center, XYZ Rotation, Size, and Invert. The Teapot mask allows you to use the pair of "&#91;x&#93; Show View Controls" checkboxes and the right-clickable shape animaton settings to reshape and animate the teapot's spline curves over time.</p>

	
<p>If you are creating a quick R&D comp experiment, the Teapot mask might just be the perfect addition to help you try out several different compositing operations.</p>
