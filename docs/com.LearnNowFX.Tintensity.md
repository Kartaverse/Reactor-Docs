## Description
    This fuse adds some Intense Colorization to your footage or elements.
    <br>It could also be used to grade log footage in Fusion.

	<p>It also adds an Alpha channel to images with a black background.</p>

	<br>It works great with pre-rendered footage like smoke or shockwave elements</br>

	<p>This fuse uses DCTL for GPU acceleration and because of this, it only works in Resolve/Fusion 15+ </p>
    <br>It can be used as an example for the use of DCTL in fuses.</br>
		<br>And of course it does work in the Free version of Davinci Resolve/Fusion.</br>

	<p>I would like to give a special thanks to Bryan Ray for teaching me all that I know about writing fuses.</p>
    <br>And Sam Treadway for all that he did for this Fuse,</br>
    <br>Thanks to him the fuse is compatible on all platforms and you have not one, but 4 different Vibrance algorithms to choose from.</br>
    <p>I would also like to thank Aleksander Westphal, June Yu, Simon Stansfield, Thibaud and the entire WSL community.</p>
    <br>I couldn't have done it without you!!</br>

    
   <p>If you would like to see a video on how to use this fuse, you can click on the "Demo" button at the bottom of the Inspector.</p>

    <p>Thank you!!</p>
