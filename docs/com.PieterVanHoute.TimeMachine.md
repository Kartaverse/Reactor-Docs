## Description
<h2>Time Machine Fuse</h2>
	
<p>A tool designed to greatly simplify very complex retiming of just about anything in Fusion.</p>

<h3>New features in version 2.11</h3>
<p>Time Machine is no longer a modifier only. It is also 3 full fledged retime tools, for images, 3D scenes and even materials!</p>
<p>Since version 2, Time Machine can be used to retime Point as well as Number parameters. Using Time Machine's many available modes, motion paths can be constructed in novel new ways.</p>

<p>Time Machine can also be used to retime animated input parameters! As an exciting use case, imagine using Suck Less Audio to modify a parameter.<br>
Now you can use Time Machine to retime that motion, effectively looping, reversing, or do any kind of crazy retimes <i>on the sample data itself</i>.</p>

<p>It's the ultimate tool for motion graphics projects and animation.</p>
	
<h3>A quick rundown of the available modes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Warp: scrubs inside the Source Start to Source End range using the Time Warp slider.</li>
<li>Remap: maps Source Start-End to Target Start-End.</li>
<li>Delta: steps through a range in user definable steps.</li>
<li>Lock Start: locks Source Start to Target Start frame, and you can use Speed/Step to go from there.</li>
<li>Lock End: locks Source End to Target End frame, and you can use Speed/Step to go from there.</li>
<li>Random: random frames from within the Source range.</li>
<li>Hold: holds a frame.</li>
<li>Skip: skips frames, so a setting of 2 starting from 1 does 111444777...</li>
<li>Offset: offsets your source range forward or backward.</li>
<li>Trigger: repeatedly runs through your frames, based on thresholds.</li>
<li>XSheet: retime your source frames using an exposure sheet with a mini scripting engine.</li>
<li>Switch: easily switch to user definable starting points. (requires Fusion 7.7 or later).</li>
</ul>
