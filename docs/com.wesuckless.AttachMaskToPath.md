## Description
<h2>Attach Mask to Path, Keep Position</h2>

<p>Run the tool script on a mask with a center position, select the path, and click okay. The script will create an offset position that will keep the tool locked in its current position, instead of having it thrown to wherever the path's center is. The mask will then animate along the path's center. Also works for transforms.</p>
