        "Description": "<h1>Attribute Spreadsheet</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.svenneve.com/?p=792\">Attribute Spreadsheet</a> was written by Sven Neve (House of Secrets) in 2013. This is my attempt of reviving this tool while adding new features to it.</p>\n<p><em>AttributeSpreadsheet</em> is a spreadsheet script to edit the input parameters of multiple Fusion tools at once. It is extremely useful for batch tool changes, and a great help for any motion graphics tasks. The most amazing part that it works with any native or third party Fusion tool, such as OFX plugins, macros, Krokodove tools and so on. Any available input is accessible from a very convenient table view. You can link any input to another with expression by a middle mouse drag. Some tools, such at Text+ <code>Font</code> or <code>Style</code>, does not even allow setting expression manually. With <em>AttributeSpreadsheet</em> you can do that easily too. As far as I know, this is the fastest, and the most reliable tool for a batch changing parameters or linking multiple Fusion inputs. It should definitely be in Reactor.</p>\n<p><em>Requirements:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.8+</li>\n<li>Fusion Standalone v.18, Davinci Resolve v.18</li>\n<li>PySide6 (can be installed automatically)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Usage:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select one or more tools in Fusion flow and start the script or press \"Refresh\" button.</li>\n<li>Select multiple values in a single column, say, \"Blend\".</li>\n<li>Start typing new numeric value and hit Enter. All Blend values for selected tools will be changed accordingly. That's the basic functionality.</li>\n<li>To link multiple tool's inputs to another tool with expression, select the column and drag with middle-click towards the cell you are linking to. </li>\n<li>Enter <code>-x</code> to discard the expression on single or multiple inputs. Once the expression is set, you cannot change the values in the table unless the expression is cleared.</li>\n<li>Use <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code> and <code>%=</code> to do mathematical expressions with current numerical values. for example: enter <code>+=0.2123</code> to default Transform Size value, and it will become <code>1.2123</code></li>\n<li>Use search bar to find inputs. You can search for multiple inputs, separated by spaces, like <code>size angle</code> to search both Size and Angle inputs.</li>\n<li>Enter numerical values or expression to point values, such as <code>Pivot</code> or <code>Center</code>. For instance, enter <code>=time</code> in the Transform Angle cell will create <code>=time</code> expression, adding <code>=time</code> and <code>0.35</code> in Center <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> values will create <code>Point(time, 0.35)</code> expression.</li>\n<li>Enter <code>p</code> in any table cell and all corresponding input attributes will be listed in Console.</li>\n<li>Click on the row header (tool name) to activate the tool.</li>\n<li>Click on column header to sort inputs alphabetically. Click on the corner button to reset sorting to default state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Current version has quite large changelog in comparison to the last known version of <code>hos_AttributeSpreadsheet</code>. You can find full list of new features and fixes inside a script file. The most significant improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point data with X and Y elements are both adjustable and now work with mathematical modifiers.</li>\n<li>You can add expressions to Point data values, such as <code>Point(Pivot.X, 0.5)</code></li>\n<li>Corner button will reset sorting to default state</li>\n<li>Tool name and ID is added to a table to improve sorting abilities</li>\n<li>Added logging, most errors are caught with Console feedback</li>\n<li>Set active tool by clicking on row header</li>\n<li>Use this script as a standalone tool (Fusion Studio feature). Provide a remote machine IP as an argument to a script to do remote management</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Automatic PySide6 installation</em></p>\n<p>My intention was to make this script as straightforward and easy to use as possible. Usually installing third party package to Python is a painless task. So we go further and strip this step, offering automatic PySide6 installation on a first launch. </p>\n<p>If there's no Pyside6 installation found on the computer, the script will show a dialogue, whether you want to install the package automatically. If clicked <code>Ok</code>, it attempts to install Pyside6 using standard pip tools. Otherwise, the command for manual installation will be shown in Console. Python modules manager <code>pip</code> should be already installed on the computer. It is a part of standard Python3 installation, thus the reason the script will require Python3 (also for maintenance purposes). Automatic PySide installation process will be visible in Fusion console. In case installation fails, please report the bug here. Once Pyside is installed, launch the script again and standard UI will be shown:</p>\n<p><em>Known issues:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All fields except numerical or point data inputs are treated as text values. This prevents unexpected behavior when changing cells values. </li>\n<li>Although script works perfectly both in Resolve and Fusion Standalone separately, sometimes, when both of these apps are loaded, the script cannot read the comp data properly. In this case you'll see <code>No comp data found. Probably both Resolve and Fusion are loaded?</code> error message. I'm looking forward to handling this issue as soon I understand why this is happening.</li>\n<li>You should avoid linking inputs to each other. This is a known bug: if you link <code>Transform1.Size</code> to <code>Transform2.Size</code> and then try to link expression from <code>Transform2.Size</code> back to <code>Transform1.Size</code>, Fusion will crash immediately. The same will happen if you try to do that with a script. Just don't.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>TODO:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add combobox to inputs with list data, such as <code>INPIDT_ComboControl_ID</code> or <code>INPIDT_MultiButtonControl_ID</code>, so you could choose the appropriate values from a dropdown instead of typing values manually. This can be tricky, because some Fusion inputs addressed by key ('1.0', '2.0') and some - by value ('Red', 'XYZ' etc). Also, this should probably exclude Fonts.</li>\n<li>Add a completer with the most commonly used search commands. For instance, if you've already been searching <code>red green blue</code>, this query will be suggested once you type <code>r</code> in search area.</li>\n<li>Add an option for partial middle-drag/linking Point data, such as link only <code>X</code> values, or only <code>Y</code>, so the expression would be like <code>Point(Transform1.Center.X, 0.5)</code>. Currently, it is possible by typing expression text to a Point X cell.</li>\n<li>Add <code>Select by ID</code> button to quickly select and load to the table all tools with the same ID as the active tool. However, this can be done with ToolManager script, so questionable.</li>\n<li>Please suggest any other improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Copyright:</em> 2011-2013, Sven Neve (House of Secrets); 2019-2023 additions by Alexey Bogomolov</p>\n<p><em>License:</em> <a href=\"https://mit-license.org/\">MIT</a></p>\n",

        "Description": "<h1>Tool Management scripts</h1>\n<p>This submission installs two scripts that allow to manage multiple tools at once. They essentially do the same job, but internally work differently, so you can choose, which tool to use. \nThe main difference between them: <code>Tool Tagger</code> uses comp data to store tool tags and select them based on this data. <code>Tool Comment Manager</code> works on a per-tool basis and stores tags in a tool's comments section. Thus, you can have a visible representation of the tagged tools in a flow (if you hover with the mouse over the tool, you'll see the tag, assigned to it, prepended with <code>%</code> symbol). This tool will erase any comment already assigned to the tagged tool, so don't use it if you want them to be intact.</p>\n<p>Either of these scripts is a great companion to a recently released to Reactor <a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=35321#p35321\">Attribute Spreadseet script</a>. Tag some tools with a Tool Management script and select these tools to adjust inputs with the <code>Attribute spreadsheet</code>. This is a very convenient workflow once you get used to it.</p>\n<h2>Tool Tagger</h2>\n<p>This is a comp data driven tool manager for making basic operations with groups Fusion nodes, such as: <em>disable, enable, toggle passthrough</em> (disabled tools become enabled and vice versa), <em>select</em> and <em>lock</em>. </p>\n<p>I wrote this script when I realized I would like to keep comments in some tools. This script has some advantages over the comment manager (see in description), and I actually prefer using it. </p>\n<p><em>Description:</em></p>\n<p>This script operates with comp data, and does not change tool comments at all. The <a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=22734#p22734\">idea</a> belongs to @PingKing. Here's his proof of concept video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmlzyVVHkIM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmlzyVVHkIM</a>. You can group different tools by assigning a special tag to them. The main difference with <code>Tool Comment Manager</code> - you can assign any number of tags to the same tool. So you can manage, say, <code>Merge1</code> and <code>Merge2</code> with a tag <em>\"My favorite Merges\"</em>, and <code>Merge1</code>, <code>Merge3</code> and <code>Merge4</code> with <em>\"Some Merges I'm slowly starting to hate\"</em> tag. This would be virtually impossible to do with a comment driven script. Unfortunately, unlike Tool Comment Manager, there won't be any visual representation of the tagged tools in a flow.</p>\n<p>List of the tags will be shown in the middle section. If the text field underneath is empty, the script will be managing all tools of the same ID.</p>\n<p><em>Usage:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select single Merge tool, click 'Disable' and all Merge tools in a comp will be disabled.</li>\n<li>Select some nodes, i.e. last two merges, then fill the text field: \"<em>my favorite merges</em>\".</li>\n<li>Click <code>Set Tag</code> or hit <code>Enter</code> to add tag to selected tools. The tag will appear in comments list.</li>\n<li>Now click Disable, and only tools with assigned tag will be disabled.</li>\n<li>Press <code>Delete Tag</code> button to delete the tag from the list and from the comp data.</li>\n<li>You can Exclude the tool(s) from particular tag with the dedicated button. \n<li>Doubleclick on a tag to select tha tagged tools</li>\n<li>Use Refresh button to load tags in a different comp without relaunching the script</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Tool Comment Manager</h2>\n<p>This is a comment based tool manager for making basic operations with Fusion nodes, such as: <em>disable, enable, toggle passthrough</em> (disabled tools become enabled and vice versa), <em>select</em> and <em>lock</em>. </p>\n<p><em>Description:</em></p>\n<p>This script is an evolution of @SirEdric's <a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/images/SE_PriorityPassthrough.eyeonscript\">Priority Passthrough script</a>. You can group different tools by assigning a special comment to them. The tool manager will operate only tools with a given comment. List of the comments will be shown in the middle section. If the text field underneath is empty, the script will be managing all tools of the same ID. The script tags tools with a comment rather than internal tool data, in order the tagged tools would be visible in a Flow.</p>\n<p><em>Usage:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select single Merge tool, click 'Disable' and all Merge tools in a comp will be disabled.</li>\n<li>Select some nodes, i.e. last two merges, then fill the text field: \"<em>my favorite merges</em>\". </li>\n<li>Click <code>Set or Replace comment</code> or hit <code>Enter</code>. The given comment will be applied to the selected tools. ALso, this comment will appear in comments list. Next time you click Disable, only these two tools will be disabled. </li>\n<li>The comment added to the tool will be prepended with <code>@</code> symbol. Thus, ToolManager will not list other commented tools. </li>\n<li>To clear the comment, press clear button in text field, then with tools selected press Set comment. The comments will be cleared. This can be applied to any tools with comments, not only the managed ones.</li>\n<li>Doubleclick on comments list to manually refresh it. I will probably replace this redundant function later to show the list of tagged tools in a console, just like the <code>Tool Tagger</code> does.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Copyright:</em> Alexey Bogomolov (mail@abogomolov.com)</p>\n<p><em>License:</em> <a href=\"https://mit-license.org/\">MIT</a></p>\n<p><em>Version:</em> v.1.3 - &#91;2020/12/08&#93;</p>\n<i>update v1.31</i>: fix Resolve 17 compatibility (omit __flags data)<li>\n\n",

        "Description": "<p>This fuse uses the Altus Denoiser CLI (command line interface) to reduce the noise in V-ray pathtracer rendered EXR imagery.</p>\n\n<p>The Altus Denoiser CLI software is available for purchase on the Innobright website:<br>\nhttps://www.innobright.com/about-altus/</p>\n\n<p>The AltusDenoiserUltra fuse is compatible with Fusion 9.0.2. AltusDenoiserUltra requires the installation of the Reactor provided SwitchElse.fuse.</p>\n\n<h2>Vray for Maya Render Channels</h2>\n\n<p>In order to use thise fuse, Altus expects you to have rendered a pair of buffer 0 (b0) and buffer 1 (b1) images that have fixed noise sampling patterns enabled. By having the seed value for the fixed noise sampling set at two different settings for the b0 and b1 images, Altus is able to more accuratly target the multi-channel noise reduction where it is required.</p>\n\n<p>Altus requires the following EXR image channels to be enabled in V-Ray's render settings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>rgb</li>\n\t<li>DiffuseFilter</li>\n\t<li>MatteShadow</li>\n\t<li>Reflection</li>\n\t<li>WorldNormals</li>\n\t<li>WorldPositions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The fastest way to generate these render elements is to turn on the V-Ray \"vrayRE_Denoiser\" and \"vrayRE_Matte_shadow\" render elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vray for Maya Fixed Noise Sampling</h2>\n\n<p>The Altus Buffer 0 Vray for Maya MEL setting is:</p>\n\n<pre>\n\tsetAttr \"vraySettings.dmcs_timeDependent\" 0;\n\tsetAttr \"vraySettings.dmcs_randomSeed\" 0;\"\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The Altus Buffer 1 Vray for Maya MEL setting is:</p>\n\n<pre>\n\tsetAttr \"vraySettings.dmcs_timeDependent\" 0;\n\tsetAttr \"vraySettings.dmcs_randomSeed\" 50000;\"\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>AltusDenoiserUltra Example Comp</h2>\n\n<p>An example Fusion comp file can be found at the \"Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/AltusDenoiser/AltusDenoiserUltra.comp\" filepath. This example composite includes a pair of V-Ray rendered b0 and b1 EXR images that you can use to learn how Altus works and test the DoD cropping and filter settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macro Usage</h2>\n\n<p>Step 1. Add the \"AltusDenoiserUltra\" macro to your comp. The macro's group is expanded by default so you can edit the settings.</p>\n\n<p>Step 2. Relink your imagery into the b0 and b1 sets of Loaders on the far left side of the macro group's flow work area. If you are working with multi-part EXRs you can manually select which part you want to extract the image channels from manually on each of the loader nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Step 3. Enable the HiQ rendering mode so the macro's embedded savers are able to interactivly render the individual multi-channel extracted exr image elements to the \"Comp:/Media/altus_input\" folder.</p>\n\n<p>Step 4. Press the \"Render\" button to render an intial denoised output to the \"Comp:/Media/altus_output\" folder.<p>\n\n<p>Step 5. Select the \"AltusDenoiserUltra\" macro and view its attributes in the Tools view. You can use the onscreen DoD crop handles to reduce the amount of processing Altus has to do down to a smaller cropped region.</p>\n\n<p>Step 6. The \"Output Mode\" control lets you switch between viewing the original \"Input Image\", and the \"Denoised Result\". When the Output Mode is seto to \"Input Image\" you are able to use the \"Buffer\" ComboControl menu to switch between viewing B0 and B1. The \"Channels\" ComboControl menu lets you view each of the Altus formatted EXR image channels that were extracted from your V-Ray render elements.</p> \n\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Altus is capable of denoising images from other production renderers like Mantra, Arnold, Maxwell Render, Mental Ray and RenderMan but it is outside the current focus and usage scope of this tool to try and implement support users of those renderers.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Processing Quality\" should be set to the faster \"Preview\" setting when you are refining the settings. Once thinge are looking close to perfect you can switch the slower but cleaner \"Production\" setting to do a slightly better output quality. The &#91;x&#93; Firefly checkbox is useful for suppresing very small super bright artifacts that happen inside specular highlights in the rendered image.</p>",

This allows you to pass along an illustrated guide about the composite to other users. Hypertext Compositor supports the use of custom Fusion comp based HTML \"a href\" anchor codes to create guided tutorials that can control the Fusion timeline, adjust comp settings, add nodes/macros/media/3D models, run scripts, and display content in the viewer window when you click on the hyperlinks in Fusion Studio 16-19+, and Resolve 16-19+. If you \"Shift+Click\" on a hyperlink a preview of the URL will be displayed.</p>\n\n<p>In Fusion Standalone/Resolve v16-19+ you can also drag an .htm file from your desktop and drop it in the Nodes view and the webpage will be displayed in a new window.<p>\n\n<p>If you would like to learn how to use the custom \"a href\" anchor codes, look in the header of the \"<a href=\"Reactor:/Deploy/Config/HypertextCompositor/\">Reactor:/Deploy/Config/HypertextCompositor/</a>\" folder based scripts for more information.</p>\n\n<h2>What is an SxS or SBS?</h2>\n\n<p>Hypertext Compositor was inpired by an old-school Fusion term called \"SxS\" / \"SBS\" / \"Side-by-Side\" that is used to represent an approach where a .lua script could be run by Fusion as soon as a .comp file of the same name was opened in the Fusion GUI, or when the composite was being rendered by the \"Fusion Render Node\" program. The Hypertext Compositor extends this Side-by-Side system to support comp specific documentation.</p>\n\n<h2>Hypertext Compositor Usage</h2>\n\n<p>If you had a composite called \"wesuckless.comp\", the SBS html sidecar file would be named \"wesuckless.htm\". When the composite is opened using the \"File &gt; Open...\" or \"File &gt; Open Recent &gt; \" menu items, the matching HTML guide would be displayed automatically.</p>\n\n<h2>Sticky Note SBS Macro</h2>\n\n<p>If you regulary move between Resolve and Fusion Studio Standalone, you might find it handy to add a \"Sticky Note SBS\" macro to your composite, in place of a regular \"Note\" node. The \"Sticky Note SBS\" macro has a button added to the UI in the Inspector view labelled \"Display SBS Help\" which can be edited in a programmer's text editor like Notepad++ (Windows), BBedit (MacOS), or GEDIT (Linux) to pre-enter a PathMap based filepath for the SBS sidecar .htm file on disk. This allows Resolve users to open the Hypertext Compositor guide that matches the current Fusion page composite.</p>\n\n<h2>Email Andrew Hazelden</h2>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com\">andrew@andrewhazelden.com</a></p>\n\n",

macOS based Apple Script code snippets from inside a Fusion Studio node-graph. This unlocks node-based automation techniques such as controlling external applications via Apple Events and OSAX (Open Scripting Architecture Extension) scripting.</p>\n\n<p>The kvrAppleScript node as has a Text data type based input connection named \"Script\". This input connection supports the use of external Vonk nodes like \"TextCreateMultiline\" or \"vTextSubFormatMultiline\" as the source of the code that will be executed when the node is rendered.If you only want Apple Script code run when a Fusion batch render is occurring, uncheck the \"Interactive Render\" checkbox.</p>\n\n<p>The first time the macro is run, you need to approve a macOS security message that says: \n\n<blockquote>\"Fusion.app\" wants access to control \"System Events.app\". Allowing control will provide access to documents and data in \"System Events.app\" and to perform actions within that app.</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about scriptable programs, open the Apple Script Editor and then select the \"File > Open Dictionary...\" menu item. You could also use the \"Record\" button to save a series of interactions into the script editor window. Copy/Paste this code back into the \"kvrAppleScript\" fuse's interface in the Resolve/Fusion Inspector view.</p>\n\n",

If that is the case then you might find the following comp script handy:</p>\n\n<p>The \"HQueue Render.py\" comp script allows Fusion Studio to submit compositing jobs for rendering via Houdini HQueue. The script works great in both a \"local queue\", and for larger render farm usage scenarios.</p>\n\n<h2>Script Compatibility</h2>\n<p>Right now the script has been tested successfully with HQueue Server on macOS and Linux.</p>\n\n<p>Windows support is currently under development.

This unlocks node-based GUI automation techniques such as controlling external applications via simulating keyboard and mouse actions.</p>\n\n<p>The kvrKeyboardMaestro node as has a Text data type based input connection named \"Macro\". This input connection supports the use of external Vonk nodes like \"TextCreate\" as the source of the macro name that will be launched when this node is rendered. If you only want Keyboard Maestro launched when a Fusion batch render is occurring, uncheck the \"Interactive Render\" checkbox.</p>\n\n<p>The fuses require the installation of \"Keyboard Maestro\" for macOS. The first time the macro is run, you need to approve a macOS security message that says: \n\n<blockquote>\"Fusion.app\" wants access to control \"Keyboard Maestro.app\". Allowing control will provide access to documents and data in \"Keyboard Maestro.app\" and to perform actions within that app.</blockquote></p>\n\n",

        "Description": "<p>Kartaverse \"Media Command\" is a scriptable interface for batch processing content that resides in your Resolve Media Pool. This streamlines the process of selecting footage, and running automation scripts on those specific items.</p>\n\n<p>When Media Command is launched it automatically scans for Lua and Python scripts that are located on your hard disk inside the \"Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/MediaCommand/\" folder. These items are added to the \"Command Script\" ComboMenu in the interface.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a long time Fusion user, you will find the Media Command script was designed to give your Media page content management operations the same power and flexibility as you have with a Fusion page \"tool\" script in the Fusion nodes view context.</p>\n\n<p><h2>Script Usage:</h2></p>\n\n<p>Step 1. Place your custom .lua or .py scripts into the \"Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/MediaCommand/\" folder.</p>\n\n<p>Step 2. Launch the Media Command script from the Resolve \"Workspaces > Scripts > Edit > Kartaverse > KartaLink > Media Command\" menu entry.</p>\n\n<p>Step 3. Select the footage you would like to batch process by clicking on the tree view row entries in the Media Command window. At the moment you need to click on the actual \"text\" words on the row to toggle the \"selected\" checkbox state.</p>\n\n<p>Step 4. Choose a script you would like to run on the selected media using the \"Command Script\" ComboMenu, then press the \"Go\" button.</p>\n",

        "Description": "<h2>Comp Session</h2>\n\n<p>The \"File &gt; Sessions &gt;\" menu allows you to quickly load and save a snapshot of the open .comp tabs that are active in Fusion Studio Standalone. The node selection state is restored for each of the comps as well. This makes it easy to return to an earlier work session.</p>\n\n<p>This approach lets you hop back into a multi-document compositing session and have all your comp work loaded up, just like it was when you saved the previous session.</p>\n\n<h2>Menu Entries</h2>\n\n<p>The \"Config:/Menus/Kartaverse Sessions.fu\" file adds the following menu entries to Fusion Studio Standalone:</p>\n\n<pre>File > Sessions:\n- Restore Session\n- Load Session...\n- --------------------\n- Save Session\n- Save Session As...\n- --------------------\n- Close Session\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n\n<p>The \"Restore Session\" menu loads the most recently used session file. Existing comp tabs will be saved and closed first.</p>\n<p>The \"Load Session...\" menu item lets you open up pre-existing .json based session files. Existing comp tabs will be saved and closed first.</p>\n<p>The \"Save Session\" menu item lets you re-save the active .json based session files to disk. This will refresh the active comp tabs and node selection values.</p>\n<p>The \"Save Sessions As...\" menu item lets you save your session to a different .json based session filename on disk.</p>\n<p>The \"Close Sessions\" menu item closes all of the open comp tabs. You are asked to save each .comp file if there are any changes.</p>\n\n<h2>Session Files</h2>\n\n<p>Comp session files are saved in a .json file format. The default comp session document storage path is:<br>\n<a href=\"file://Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Support/Kartaverse/Sessions/\">Reactor://Deploy/Scripts/Support/Kartaverse/Sessions/</a></p>\n\n",

        "Description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>This Kartaverse stitching example shows an interesting workflow that batch stitches a PTGui Pro v12 .pts file inside of Fusion's node graph. The Kartaverse PT data nodes parse the .pts file to extract the location of the PTGui Pro batch rendered panoramic image.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, rest of the example composite shows how to create a simulated virtual production LED video stage wall using Fusion's 3D workspace. The panoramic imagery is automatically placed onto this LED video wall surface. A Camera3D node can then be flown around inside the virtual production stage filming volume to create previz versions of shots with the wrap-around live-action background plate visible.</p>\n\n<h2>About the Footage</h2>\n\n<p>The \"Nighttime View of Caguas, Puerto Rico (Dec 2021)\" media was filmed by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cave_manpr/\">Robert Moreno</a>. Robert's photographic process helped produced a cylindrical image projection output, with plenty of overlap to allow for precise artist-controlled blending and masking of each view.</p>\n\n<p>This sample footage was captured using a Nikon D750 Camera with an AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm F/2.8 ED lens. A Nodal Ninja panoramic head was adjusted to an indexed rotation value of 15 degrees per view rotation increment, and 12 view angles were captured in the Nikon RAW NEF image format starting at 1:30 AM, local time on 2021-12-08. The pictures had an average of a 30 second exposure time, ISO 1600, aperture F/8, and the content was captured using a manual exposure mode.</p>\n\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<p>Kartaverse \"PT\" data nodes, \"Vonk Ultra\", and \"kvrViewer\" from the Reactor Package Manager.</p>\n\n",

Kartaverse STMap template media provides ready to use warping template images. These floating point 32-bit per channel EXR maps allow you to process dual fisheye VR180 camera footage without any intermediate temporary video files, or external tools being required. It is recommended to use these EXR images inside of Resolve with the <a href=\"https://kartaverse.github.io/Kartaverse-Docs/#/kvrSuperSTMap\">kvrSuperSTMap</a> node.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use these STMaps with any compositing package. If you have access to real-time graphics tools like <a href=\"https://kartaverse.github.io/Kartaverse-Docs/#/TouchDesigner\">TouchDesigner</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.assimilateinc.com/products/livefx/\">Assimilate LifeFX</a>, you can load in the EXR formatted STMaps and perform live on-set stitching of your VR180 content while you are filming it, and even stream that immersive video to the web or to an HMD.\n\n<p>Note: The kvrSuperSTMap node is a unique warping tool designed specifically for Resolve/Fusion. kvrSuperSTMap allows SBS Stereo 3D imagery that is being warped with a pre-computed STMap to have the horizontal and vertical disparity corrected with a pair of built-in X/Y Shift controls. This allows a VR video editor to have fine grained control over the stereo convergence properties directly on the Resolve Edit page on a \"shot by shot\" basis. This correction works by the right eye and left eye SBS views having the optical frame center adjusted as a pre-processing stage before the STMap warping stage happens. This allows for compensations of the floating optics that exist in a Canon EOS dual fisheye lens.</p>\n\n<p>When this atom package is installed you can explore the STMap images in this folder:</p>\n<pre><a href=\"file://Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/Kartaverse/KartaVP/STmaps/\">Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/Kartaverse/KartaVP/STmaps/</a></pre>\n\n<p>If for any reason, you need to create your own custom STMap warping templates from scratch, make sure to check out the Kartaverse \"<a href=\"https://kartaverse.github.io/Kartaverse-Docs/#/kvrFisheyeStereo\">Lens Profiles</a>\" atom package in Reactor. This is where you will find the kvrFisheyeStereo node that streamlines a VR180 lens profiling task when you need to work with new cameras and lens combinations.</p>\n\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kartaverse \"kvrSuperSTMap\" macro from the Reactor Package Manager</li>\n\t<li>EmberlightVFX \"STMapper.fuse\" from the Reactor Package Manager</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>About the STMaps</h2>\n<p>Special thanks go out to Nick Brazzi for his encouragement to finally create this atom package.</p>\n\n<h2>How to use the ZIP Archives</h2>\n\n<p>The Kartaverse STMaps folder holds multi-part ZIP archives for each STMap shipped. When expanded you will be able use the provided STMap warping template file that has a name like:</p>\n\n<pre>Canon_R5C_RF5.2mm_DF_SRC_8192x4320_STMap.0001.exr</pre>\n\n<p>In order to expand a multi-part ZIP archive, you can use a program like <a href=\"https://www.winzip.com/en/download/winzip/\">WinZIP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.win-rar.com/download.html\">WinRAR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.7-zip.org/\">7-Zip</a>, etc. To expand the zip archive, start by selecting the first file named \"RF 5.2mm F2.8L Dual Fisheye.zip.001\". The zip archive expanding tool will then re-assemble the file and extract the EXR image contents.</p>\n\n<p>Note: The Reactor repository is hosted on GitLab. The usage of a multi-part zip archive is not ideal but it is the best solution available to bypass the 100MB filesize limits imposed by GitLab. Sorry you have to deal with the fallout from these limitations. We did the best we could in this case.</p>\n\n",

Kartaverse \"kvrSuperSTMap\" effects template is an Edit page based STmap image projection warping tool. It is designed to be used with SBS (Side-By-Side) 180VR video content creation workflows. This effects template is the next-gen replacement for the earlier STMapperInline toolset.</p>\n\n<p>This tool is unique in that it allows for horizontal and vertical stereo disparity adjustments to happen prior to the STmap warping stage. Now you can skip re-generating the STMap warping template every time you need to adjust the zero parallax distance in a 180VR shot.<p>\n\n<p>Pre-made STMap images for VR180 footage processing, are available in the \"KartaVP Example | STMap Templates\" atom package in Reactor.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a fast way to build a new SBS 180VR STmap warping template, check out the \"<a href=\"https://kartaverse.github.io/Reactor-Docs/#/com.AndrewHazelden.KartaVP.LensProfiles\">Kartaverse Lens Profiles</a>\" atom package. Then use the bundled \"kvrFisheyeStereo\" node in the Fusion page to generate your fresh \"camera calibrated\" STMap image in mere moments.</p>\n\n<p>The kvrSuperSTMap node was created in collaboration with Dusk Rotors.</p>\n\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kartaverse \"KartaVP\" nodes from the Reactor Package Manager</li>\n\t<li>EmberlightVFX \"STMapper.fuse\" from the Reactor Package Manager</li>\n\t<li>Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio based GlobalAlign node (not available in Resolve Free)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

kvrVignette node allows you to quickly and easily generate a 180VR stereo 3D compatible dual fisheye lens masking pattern.</p>\n\n<p>A new Resolve Edit page \"Generator\" macro version of the kvrVignette tool is available. Select Edit page the Effects tab's \"Toolbox &gt; Generators &gt; KartaVP &gt; Color &gt; kvrVignette\" entry and drag it to a video track above your 180VR video content.\n\n<p>Note: A radial vignetting effect can be used with a \"multiply\" transfer mode to fade out the perimeter edge-zone area of an 180VR dual fisheye video clip. This technique masks the edges of the left and right eye views so you can guide the viewer's attention to where it matters most. Most importantly, using a vignetting process on your 180VR immersive media is an affordable way to hide the lens element that is visible in the opposite eye view of a dual fisheye lens based camera rig.</p>\n\n",

href=\"https://github.com/Kartaverse\">Kartaverse</a> is an academic research project exploring computational imaging techniques. The Kartaverse software provides a free open-source post-production pipeline that is optimized for the immersive media sector. If you can imagine it, Kartaverse can help you create it in XR!</p>\n\n<p>The Kartaverse plug-in works inside of Blackmagic Design's Resolve and Fusion software. It provides the essential tools for VR, panoramic 360&deg; video stitching, and spatial media editing workflows.</p>\n\n<h2>Example Comps:</h2>\n\n<p>The Kartaverse example comps are installed on your system in the \"AllData:/Reactor/\" PathMap folder path of:<br>\n<a href=\"file://Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/Kartaverse/\">Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/Kartaverse/</a></p>\n\n<h2>3rd Party Libraries:</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to use KartaVR's Lua scripts you should install the \"KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries\" atom package in Reactor which is a 502 MB collection of the best open-source programs used to power VR workflows.</p>\n\n<p>This \"KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries\" package includes just about everything you'd need to build out an effective pipeline, and it can be done in an install that is completed in mere minutes. It could take someone hours to collect and install all of those open-source tools tools manually that are provided by the Reactor \"Bin\" category atom packages.</p>\n\n<p>These Reactor \"Bin\" cateogry packages are installed on your system in the \"AllData:/Reactor/\" PathMap folder path of:<br>\n<a href=\"file://Reactor:/Deploy/Bin/\">Reactor:/Deploy/Bin/</a></p>\n\n<h2>License Terms</h2>\n\n<p>Kartaverse is LPGL/GPL licensed. Kartaverse can be used on personal and commerical projects at no cost. Kartaverse is able to be installed on an unlimited number of computers and render nodes via the Reactor package manager.

atom package, Reactor will ask for your permission to launch an \"<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/WeSuckLess/Reactor/blob/master/Docs/Creating-Atom-Packages.md#installscripts-and-uninstallscripts\">InstallScript</a>\" code snippet that runs the \"chmod -R 755\" shell command on each of the \"Bin\" Category based atom package's executable CLI (command-line) programs. This is required so the CLI programs can be started by the Lua based KartaVR menu items. If you would like the KartaVR lua scripts to be able to perform correctly, you have to approve each of the InstallScript dialog requests manually (which is displayed in a syntax highlighted Lua code snippet preview window).</p>\n\n<p>Note: You have the option to approve or skip running each of the InstallScript code blocks, if you wish, and then can manually adjust the Reactor Bin folder content's disk permissions manually on your own.</p>\n\n<h2>For More Info:</h2>\n\n<h3>Kartaverse Project Page</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Kartaverse\">https://github.com/Kartaverse</a></p>\n\n<h2>Workflow Guides</h2>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tewIaHZh8mWI8x5BzlpZBkF8eXhK2b_XhTWiU_93HBA\">Kartaverse Workflows | Immersive Pipeline Integration Guide</a> learning resource is available. The free guide has over 512 pages of content that covers the primary steps required to get a working content creation pipeline established from scratch for artists working at a freelancer, or small boutique studio scale of operation. Additional, expanded chapters cover broader Resolve/Fusion page usage concepts that will help you take your composting and 360VR content creation skills to the next level.</p>\n\n<h2>Kartaverse Technical Support</h2>\nTechnical support for Kartaverse/KartaVR is handled by the official <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/kartaverse\">Kartaverse Google Group</a>. If you've got a question about 360VR and immersive workflows in Resolve and Fusion Standalone, the Kartaverse User Group is the place to get it answered.</p>\n\n<h2>Email Andrew Hazelden</h2>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com\">andrew@andrewhazelden.com</a></p>\n\n",

These scripts are accesed using the \"Script &gt; KartaVR &gt; Geometry &gt; \" menu in Fusion.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Send Geometry to Lightwave Modeler.lua\" script takes your FBXMesh3D and AlembicMesh3D node content and opens it up in Lightwave for editing. This speeds up the process of doing a quick .OBJ model edit such as UV layout change.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Send Geometry to usdview\" script takes AlembicMesh3D nodes that are selected in the Nodes view and sends the .abc models to usdview.

        "Description": "<p>The KartaVR Movies collection of scripts provide tools for capturing video, extracing image sequences, and merging stereo video clips.</p>\n\n<h2>Video Snapshot</h2>\n\n<p>The \"Video Snapshot\" script allows you to capture video into Fusion/Resolve's Fusion page from a live video input source such as an HDMI/SDI/USB/Thunderbolt video device via Windows DirectShow or macOS AV Foundation libraries. After you capture the footage, your media can be added to the active comp by clicking the \"Add Loader node\" button. If you are saving your captured footage to the \"Comp:/\" PathMap location in the Video Snapshot settings, make sure you actually saved the .comp file to disk *first* so the relative PathMap is resovled correctly. Clicking the \"?\" button in the Video Snapshot window will display a built-in HTML help document in a window.</p> \n\n<h2>Combine Stereo Movies</h2>\n<p>The \"Combine Stereo Movies\" script allows you to merge separate left and right eye view stereo movies into over/under, and side by side stereo formats. You can do this with H.264, H.265, and PreRes videos. Internally the script uses the open-source FFmpeg command-line program which is installed using the Reactor \"Bin\" category provided atom package.</p>\n\n<h2>Convert Movies to Image Sequences</h2>\n<p>The \"Convert Movies to Image Sequences\" script allows you to batch convert a folder of movie files into individually named image sequences and extracted audio files. This is handy if you want to work reliable in Fusion with a series of Loader nodes (and image sequences) in your composite but the project you are doing has provided you with a large folder of MP4/ProRes clips you need to transcode.</p>\n\n<p>This script is an integral tool if you want to work with video sourced media in a PTGui Pro based 360VR pipeline. The workflow combination of the \"Convert Movies to Image Sequences\" script, KartaVR's \"Batch Builder Extractor/Creator\" scripts, and PTGui Pro's Batch Builder tool can be an effective and affordable way to stitch 360VR footage coming from fisheye or rectilinear image projections, without falling into the typical trap of having to pay for high-cost, subscription only, 360VR video stitching tools...</p>\n",

        "Description": "<p>The KartaVR \"Send Media to\" scripts allow you to pass media from Fusion to the rest of your production pipeline in only a few clicks. The \"Send Media to\" tools can super-charge your productivity by allowing you to make Fusion/Resolve Fusion page's \"Nodes/Flow\" view workarea into a \"desktop\" like hub for your digital content production workflows.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Send Media to\" scripts provide instant 1-click interconnectivity from your Node view selected Loader/Saver node content. This atom package also provides a script that lets you launch the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631\">YouTube 360</a> / Facebook 360 centricSpatial Media Metadata injector application quickly from the menus inside of Fusion/Resolve now, too.</p>\n\n<h2>Another Hidden Gem in KartaVR</h2>\n\n</p>A hidden gem that has been in KartaVR (and the earlier Domemaster Fusion Macros) for years is the ability to use a TouchDesigner 360VR workflow connection path that merges offline 360VR compositing in Fusion/Resolve, with a PTGui Pro v10 created .pts camera calibration file, with TouchDesigner's live 360VR video streaming tech that can push video streams from your Laptop or Desktop system to the cloud, and onto mobile devices or HMDs.</p>\n\nTouchDesigner provides HMD connectivity support, the ability to have multiple live video input devices, support for multiple concurrent fullscreen HDMI/SDI/DisplayPort/Thunderbolt/DVI video outputs from your GPU, and the nodes required to do HLS and RTSP streaming of cleanly stitched LatLong, domemaster, cylindrical, cubemap, and custom UV layout (UV warping map) based image projections. And you can do this streaming approach in 360&deg; 2D monoscopic, or sterescopic 3D stitched formats if you know how to work your copy of PTGui Pro in the advanced mode to create the required .pts camera alignment file, and know how to make the requried node connections in TouchDesigner.</p>\n\n<p>This multi-view UV pass warping, and video stream stitching approach works fast and effectively if you want to do some live video streaming and 360VR multi-camera stitching in TouchDesigner. This is powered using KartaVR + PTGui Pro to quickly generate the essential and highly precise \"UV pass\" warping maps templates for each of your camera rig's camera views.</p>\n\n<p>These UV pass warping maps are generated by KartaVR directly from a PTGui Pro v10 .pts project file in less then a minute using the handy Generate UV Pass in PTGui script!</p>\n\n<h2>Where do I find the \"Send Media to\" scripts in Fusion and Resolve?</h2>\n\n<p>The \"Send Media to\" scripts are accessible in Fusion Standalone's \"Script &gt; KartaVR &gt; Send Media to &gt;\" menu. In Resolve the scripts can be accessed inside the Fusion page environment using the \"Workspace &gt; Scripts &gt; KartaVR &gt; Send Media to &gt;\" menu. Make sure to run the \"Edit Send Media to Preferences\" script once to select the right executable filepaths for the external applications you plan to use with Fusion.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Send Media to\" scripts are installed by Reactor to the local folder of:<br>\n<a href=\"file://Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Comp/KartaVR/Send Media to/\">Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Comp/KartaVR/Send Media to/</a></p>\n\n",

        "Description": "<p>The KartaVR &quot;Virtual Production&quot; atom allows you optimize your on-set VFX workflows and interact with match moving department provided information like camera data, point clouds, and stand-in models. This is essential for effective scene integration and virtual produciton efforts in Fusion.\n\n<p>The scripts in this atom package are the rare and exotic &quot;rosetta stone&quot; like tools that will allow your pipeline to interchange Fusion matchmoving data with external DCC apps, and make it a painless process to export PIXAR USD ASCII and Maya ASCII formatted copies of your Fusion 3D scene graph based nodes.</p>\n\t\n<h2>Export Point Clouds</h2>\n\n<p>The &quot;Export Point Cloud&quot; script is allows you to export XYZ ASCII (.xyz), PLY ASCII (.ply), JSON Array (.json), PIXAR USD ASCII (.usda), Maya ASCII 2019 (.ma), and Maya MOVE ASCII (.mov) format.</p>\n\n<p>PointCloud3D node based points or FBXMesh3D node OBJ mesh vertices can be exported to XYZ ASCII (.xyz), PLY ASCII (.ply), and JSON Array (.json), formats. Camera3D nodes with per-frame Keyframe animated XYZ translation/rotation keys can be exported to the PIXAR USD ASCII (.usda), and Maya MOVE ASCII (.mov) format. Static (non-animated) Camera3D nodes can be exported to the Maya ASCII 2019 (.ma) format. Keyframe animated FBXMesh3D nodes with per-frame XYZ translation/rotation keys can be exported to the Maya MOVE ASCII (.mov) format. AlembicMesh3D nodes can be exported to the PIXAR USD ASCII (.usda), Maya ASCII 2019 (.ma), and Maya MOVE ASCII (.mov) format.</p>\n\n<p>Note: <i>There is a &quot;KartaVR DragDrop&quot; atom package in Reactor that provides a matching .xyz point cloud importer functionality via dragging the .xyz file from your desktop folder into the Fusion/Resolve v16+ nodes views.</i></p>\n\n<h2>For More Information About Camera Metadata</h2>\n\n<p>If you would like find out how to extract the IMU metadata information from an video file, check out the Gyroflow toolset and its new motion data export options:<br>\n<a href=\"http://gyroflow.xyz/\">http://gyroflow.xyz/</a></p>\n\n",

        "Description": "<p>LifeSaver is a fuse based replacement for the traditional Saver or MediaOut nodes. This fuse uses EXRIO for the file output and supports multi-channel and multi-part EXR image saving. This node is special in that you can use the same node in comps that are created inside of both Resolve's Fusion page and inside of Fusion Standalone.</p>\n\n<p>Fusion 9-18 or Resolve 15-18 is required.</p>\n\n<p>Now includes customizable EXR compression format support.</p>\n\n<h1>Usage</h1>\n\n<p>Enter the filename for your image sequence into the Filename field.</p>\n\n<p>The LifeSaver fuse allows you to save additional multi-part EXR image elements to the same EXR file using the following technique:</p>\n\n<p>Step 1. Switch to the Channels tab and click the '+' button to add a new image input connection.</p>\n\n<p>Step 2. In the Channels tab set new the 'Export Part #' ComboControl to 'Enabled', and update the 'Layer Name' so it is relevant.</p>\n\n<p>Step 3. Connect your imagery to the new input connection on the fuse so it is written to the multi-part EXR output.</p>\n\n<p>Step 4. You can use the fuse's 'Preview Input Connection' ComboControl to send a specific input image # to the Fuse's output connection. This makes it easier to work with a specific multi-part EXR exported image element further downstream in your flow, after the LifeSaver node</p>\n\n<p>If you have added several extra node inputs to the LifeSaver fuse but have no images connected to them you should switch to the Channels tab and set the disconnected input's 'Export Part #' ComboControl menu to 'Disabled'</p>\n\n<p>Note: Currently the EXR image format is the only supported output format in the LifeSaver fuse. In the future, it is (theoretically) possible to use the fuse based Clip() function to write out each of the individual flat image channels to disk using other image formats if that was a popular and frequently requested feature.</p>\n\n<h1>Tokens</h1>\n\n<p>LifeSaver supports the use of the following pre-defined token values in the Filename field. If any other value is written inside the ${} token format it will be looked up as if it was an environment variable.</p>\n\n<pre>\n${VERSION} - The LifeSaver node 'Version' field\n${UUID} - The LifeSaver node 'UUID' field (f9fa311b-904c-4b93-892f-0d772887db88)\n${COMP} - The current Fusion comp name (Composition1)\n${COMPWIDTH} - The current comp default width (1920)\n${COMPHEIGHT} - The current comp default height (1080)\n${NODE} - The LifeSaver node name (LifeSaver1)\n${FPS} - The current frame rate (24)\n${FRAME} - The current unpadded frame number (1001)\n${STARTFRAME} - The global start frame (1001)\n${ENDFRAME} - The global end frame (1144)\n${DURATION} - The global time duration (144)\n${DATE} - The date in YYYY-MM-DD format (2018-06-16)\n${TIME} - The time in HH.MM.SS format (14.59.05)\n${HOME} - The Home folder name (/Users/andrew)\n${USER} - The current user account name (andrew)\n${HOSTNAME} - The computer's host name (Pine.local)\n${SEP} - The file separator slash (/ or \\)\n${PLATFORM} - The OS Platform (Mac/Windows/Linux)\n${FUHOST} - Is Fusion or Resolve the host package (Fusion/Resolve)\n${FUVERSION} - The version of Fusion is running (9.02/15)\n${UUID} - The per frame UUID value (f9fa311b-904c-4b93-892f-0d772887db88)\n${SHELL1}-${SHELL4} - The Shell tokens textfield content is run in the Terminal/Command Prompt and the return value captured (echo Hello_World)\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Supported Frame Padding Indicators</h2>\n\n<h3>${FRAME}</h3>\n\nThe current unpadded frame number (1001).\n\n<h3>0000</h3>\n\nThe number you type in at the end of the filename before the file extension can be used as a frame padding indicator. The number of digits you add define how much padding is added. You can also type a number other then '0000' like '1001' and this value will be used along side the 'Sequence Offset' value on the node when you have the [x] Saver Relative Numbering checkbox enabled.\n\n<h3>&#37;04d</h3>\n\nThe c-code style printf integer number formating symbol can be used to define the frame padding token.\n\n<h3>####</h3>\n\nThe number sign/hash/octothorp # character can be used to define the frame padding (0000).\n\n\n<h2>Filename Examples</h2>\n\n<p>Filename Token Example 1:<br>\nComp:/${COMP}/${COMP}_${NODE}_${VERSION}.0000.exr</p>\n\n<p>This would result in a rendered EXR image filename like:<br>\n/Volumes/VFX/MultiChannel/MultiChannel_LifeSaver1_v001.0000.exr</p>\n\n<p>Filename Token Example 2:<br>\nComp:/${COMP}/${COMP}_${NODE}.$06d.exr</p>\n\n<p>This would result in a rendered EXR image filename like:<br>\n/Volumes/VFX/MultiChannel/MultiChannel_LifeSaver1.000000.exr</p>\n",

Simple and easy.</p>\n\n<p>Nusion is available as a self-hosted web app that runs directly in your web browser. The new plugin integration version of \"Nusion for Fusion\" can be installed in Resolve's Fusion page/Fusion Studio using the community maintained Reactor Package manager. The \"Nusion for Fusion\" plugin allows you to access a \"Edit &gt; Paste Nusion\" menu item.

The design idea of those two fuses is to enable Fusion based TDs to take on workflow tasks that need an interactive CLI (command-line) based \"image pipe\" equavalent to the built-in \"RunCommand\" node.</p>\n\n<p>This concept is very powerful in that it makes it possible to create new fuses that could interactively push live image content from the Fusion node graph out to external CLI tools, and then automatically and seamlessly bring the resulting imagery back into the flow, on-the-fly, in a dynamic and unbroken, per-timeline frame based approach that would work equally well on Fusion Render Nodes and artist based Fusion GUI sessions.</p>\n\n<p>If fuse writing TDs ever wanted to access external CLI based image denoiser libraries, OpenCV, Tensor AI/machine learning tools, hardware video I/O tools, NDI network frame sharing tools, Syphon, Imagemagick, FFmpeg, or anything else that takes an image input and generates an image output, you'd need this special GetFrame and PutFrame combo of techniques.</p>\n\n<h2>Fusion/Resolve Requirements</h2>\n\t\n<p>This fuse is compatible with Fusion Standalone 16+ and Resolve 16+.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the \"PutFrame.fuse\" can't be used in Fusion 9 Standalone since the required Fuse API functionality did not exist yet.</p>\n\n<h2>Email Andrew Hazelden</h2>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com\">andrew@andrewhazelden.com</a></p>\n",

It is simmilar to other apps, where you have \"outside\" (here: unchecked) and \"both\"/\"centerd\" (here: checked)\nKEEP IN MIND: When checking the \"Grow Inside\" checkbox the Outside Only Controls won't work anymore (in this case you would want the inside anyways)\nWhich leads me to the next point:\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How to use the Outside Only Controls?</strong>\n<br>\nthe slider to change FIRST is the \"Fill Ammount\", this will slowly remove the Border/Outline from the inside of your Input.\nHowever this might destroy the edges, by loosing details in the edges. This is where the \"Fill Fix Edges\" slider comes into place.\nThis should only be used if the edges are ruined, on its own it should NOT be used to get rid of the outlines on the inside. Adjust it slightly untlill the Edges are fixed.\nIf the edges can't be fixed with those two slider, there is always the option to use the Effect Mask input to manualy remove the Outline/Border from the image at specific parts.\n\nKEEP IN MIND to use both sliders just untill they comoplete the job, not further:\nFill Ammount, should be used untill every inside edge is fully removed (even if the edges a ruined), not a bit further,\nthen, and only then you should use the Fill Fix Edges Slider if you are unhyppy with the edges. Adjusting the Slider to much will only ruin it more.\nThese contorlls might not always Work\n",

Basically, the problem arises even with static objects which are in focus, because there is always some softness in the practical image. The most obvious solution to this is either to suppress (desaturate) the background color or to shrink the objects' edges.</p>\n\n<p>In first case, you may have a problem if the background luminance is different, for instance, if you key dark objects against white (like trees against the sky). In second case, the blurring may be so strong, that the objects disappear completely with shrinking.</p>\n\n<p>VFXPedia Thread:<br>\nhttps://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index8206.html?title=Settings_and_Macros/BlurredEdgesRestoration_Description</p>\n\n<p>by Gregory Chalenko<br>\nhttp://www.compositing.ru/Research/Tools/BlurredEdgesRestoration/</p>",

Sensor Database</h2></center>\n<p>This script allows you to apply camera sensor information to BMD Fusion Studio based CameraTracker, LensDistort, Camera3D, uCamera, Renderer3D, and uRenderer nodes. The open-source camera sensor database project is community maintained, and is continously improving with more DCC package integrations on the way. The database supports new camera sensor submissions on the <a href=\"https://github.com/EmberLightVFX/Camera-Sensor-Database/issues/new/choose\">GitHub issues page</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Online and Offline Usage</h2>\n<p>When you have a new camera body to work with in production, the internet connected nature of this toolset means you won't have to repeatedly look up the values manually in the future, as additions can be submitted and synced to the database in record time. Also, the script caches the downloaded sensors.json data locally so it is possible to use the toolset 100% offline as well. This is great when you want to bring your Laptop to set and won't have a reliable internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>For more info, please check out:<br>\n<a href=\"https://emberlightvfx.github.io/Camera-Sensor-Database/#/\">https://emberlightvfx.github.io/Camera-Sensor-Database/#/</a></p>\n\n<p>WSL Thread:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=48931#p48931\">https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=48931#p48931</a></p>\n",

It filters out the Monte Carlo noise inherent to stochastic ray tracing methods like path tracing, reducing the amount of necessary samples per pixel by even multiple orders of magnitude (depending on the desired closeness to the ground truth).</p>\n\n<p>The filters can denoise images either using only the noisy color (beauty) buffer, or, to preserve as much detail as possible, can optionally utilize auxiliary feature buffers as well (e.g. albedo, normal). Such buffers are supported by most renderers as arbitrary output variables (AOVs) or can be usually implemented with little effort.</p>\n\n<p>Intel Open Image Denoise supports Intel&reg; 64 architecture based CPUs and compatible architectures, and runs on anything from laptops, to workstations, to compute nodes in HPC systems. It is efficient enough to be suitable not only for offline rendering, but, depending on the hardware used, also for interactive ray tracing.\n<br>A CPU with support for at least SSE4.1 is required to run Intel Open Image Denoise.</br></p>\n\n<p>For more info, please check:</p>\n\n<br>WSL thread: <a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=3998\">https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=3998</a></br>\n<br>Oidn webpage: <a href=\"https://openimagedenoise.github.io/\">https://openimagedenoise.github.io/</a></br>\n\n\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n\n<br>v1.1, 2020-04-19</br>\n<br>Fixed memory not being released after denoising</br>\n<br>An error message will now show in the console telling you what went wrong.</br>\n<br />\n<br>v1.0, 2020-04-13:</br>\n<br>First release!

It's basically the same as <A HREF=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=39982#p39982\">Millolab 's Vector Warp macro</a> but with additional features.</p>\n\n<h2>For More info</h2>\nCheck out the development thread on WSL for more details about the fuse:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=46092#p46092\">https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=46092#p46092</a>\n\n<h2>YouTube Video Tutorial</h2>\nCheck out the \"Fusion Vector Warp beta tutorial\" video:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7APGa7Mvk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7APGa7Mvk</a>\n\n<h2>Usage Notes</h2>\n<p>The fuse itself doesn't create any vectors. If you don't have any, use the Optical Flow node before this fuse. This fuse accumulates the vectors frame by frame. If you jump between non-consecutive frames the result will be scrambled. Use the buttons to process the image correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The \"CopyAux\" channel will look up your node-tree for a CopyAux node and will automatically change its aux channel to Vector/Back Vector as needed. If the wrong CopyAux node gets selected for some reason, drag the correct one into the Aux Node box in the UI.</p>\n\n<p>If using the RGB channel as vectors, make sure it uses Forward Vector for frames earlier than the source frame and Back Vector for frame after the source frame.</p>\n\n<p>The preview uses your ram to cache the result. If you don't have enough ram preview won't work correctly. In that case, render out the result directly insted. The fuse will render out exr files in 32bit with zip compression.</p>\n\n",

The data can be zoomed and moved.</p>\n<p>The play point is set in the middle of the picture. Based on the fuse modifier SuckLessAudioModifier by Pieter Van Houte.\n\n<p>-                      </p>\n\n<font color=\"yellow\"> Waveformparameter:</font>\n<p>There are three parameters for setting the waveform's timing: 1) Proxy 2) Zoom 3) Resolution</p>\n \n<ol>\n\t<li>Proxy: This multiplies the sample pool without increasing the number of pixels shown</li>\n\t<li>Zoom: This also multiplies the sample pool, but all values \u200b\u200bare also displayed (as far as can be displayed)</li>\n\t<li>Resolution: Acts as a divisor for the displayable pixels -> Resolution = 2 with HD -> 1920/2</li>\n\t<li></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You can choose left, right and stereo channel. The stereo signal (Both) is generated by maximum formation of the two channels.</p>\n<p>After loading the data from file, arrays will be filled with nummerical data. The size of the audio file is limited to 50 MB in order not to make the arrays too large.</p>\n<p>The audio data can be moved forward or backward by up to 50 frames. A crosshair can be shown and two different envelopes can be selected.</p>\n\n<p>-                      </p>\n\n<font color=\"yellow\"> Amplitude Spectrum:</font>\n<p>An amplitude spectrum of the loaded WAV file can be displayed instead of the waveform (control page spectrum) \nAttention: The correct settings for the waveform should then be set to 1 for proxy, zoom and resolution. Only then will the FFT display the mathematically correct spectrum. \nHowever, interesting effects can also be achieved with this parameters. <p>\n<p>The FFT window is configurable. There are 4 different types of display: raw, bars, smooth and needles. \nThe support points can be set equidistant. Then sections can be combined, which are also shown in the 4 forms. \nThe color of the spectrum can be set via the color control page.<p>\n\n<p>If you have selected the display of the spectrum, the \"Elongation\" functionality can be activated. \nA window above the spectrum can be selected here with offset and width. The selected data are calculated with the \"Operator\" parameter to be set and visualized as a bar. \nThis value \"Elongation\" can be used by other nodes by \"Connect to\".<p>\n\n<p>-                      </p>\n\n<font color=\"yellow\"> Steady Waveform:</font>\n<p>With the \"Steady Waveform\" functionality, you can determine how much audio data a so-called seed frame is formed from by selecting the number of frames. \nThe seed frames are output directly, the \"missing\" are calculated.<p>\n\n<p>-                      </p>\n\n<font color=\"yellow\"> Filter:</font>\n<p>The Samplingdata can be filtered by three frequency bands: Lowpass 0-300 Hz, Bandpass 300 Hz - 3kHz and Highpass 3kHz-20kHz.<p>\n\n<p>-                      </p>\n\n<font color=\"yellow\"> Elongation with Schmitt-Trigger:</font>\n<p>Elongation can be mapped to On/Off-Values with Hystersis.<p>\n\n<p>Elongation for Spectrum has now three Elongations.

It only works with the basic Track node, not the Planar or Camera Trackers.</p>\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Perform your Track, as usual. Create the MT_FlexiTrack node. Drag your Tracker node to the Tracker input field in FlexiTrack's control panel. If you wish to stabilize, simply put FlexiTrack after your footage and set the sliders for the amount of stabilization you want: A value of 0 turns stabilization off entirely. A value of 1 applies 100% of the stabilization. There are separate sliders for X and Y, so you could, for instance, remove all vertical bounce but leave horizontal motion intact.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to matchmove instead of stabilizing, click the Export Destabilizer button to create a copy of the node that applies the data in reverse. There is, unfortunately, no way to determine what order controls appear in when creating a node by script, so the controls in the Destabilizer will appear in a random order.</p>\n\n<p>WSL thread: <a href=https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1492&p=18725>FlexiTrack: A stabilize helper macro</a>. https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1492&p=18725</p>",

        "Description": "<h1>InstantNGP (Neural Graphics Primitives)</h1>\n\n<p>Ever wanted to train a NeRF model of a fox in under 5 seconds? Or fly around a scene captured from photos of a factory robot? Of course you have! NVIDIA InstantNGP (iNGP) allows you to work with four neural graphics primitives: neural radiance fields (NeRF), signed distance functions (SDFs), neural images, and neural volumes. In each case, we train and render a MLP with multiresolution hash input encoding using the tiny-cuda-nnframework.</p>\n\n<h2>Now with VR Support!</h2>\n<p>The latest release of NVIDIA InstantNGP adds VR support for OpenXR based HMDs. This allows live-action captured volumetric NeRF scenes to be explored in 6DoF VR. Also, one can directly edit NeRF scenes using a VR hand controller to modify digital environments by erasing objects in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-trained NeRF models can be shared with others using the drag and drop compatible &quot;.ingp&quot; based single file deliverable asset format. This technique uses a scene snapshot to containerize NeRF assets into a compact format that can be loaded and saved on demand.</p>\n\n<h2>Open Source License</h2>\n<p>InstantNGP is covered by a <a href=\"https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\">NVIDIA Source Code License</a>. Please contact the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/inquiries/\">NVIDIA Research Licensing</a> team for more information about commercial usage of this technology in film & TV production.</p>\n\n<h2>Compatibility</h2>\n<p>This atom package provides a Windows 10 & 11 compatible build of NVIDIA InstantNGP that works with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3000 and 4000 series GPUs. If you have an earlier NVIDIA GeForce or Quadro RTX GPU model, you can download a custom build of InstantNGP for that exact chipset from the <a href=\"https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp#windows-binary-release\">Windows Binary Release</a> section on the InstantNGP project's GitHub repo page.\n\n<h2>Atom Packaging</h2>\n<p>The Reactor Package Manager based atom package distribution of InstantNGP for Resolve/Fusion is maintained by the Kartaverse developer <a href=\"mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com\">Andrew Hazelden</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>For More Info</h2>\n<h3>NVIDIA Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ2hcC1orc4\">YouTube | NVIDIA Instant NeRF: NVIDIA Research Turns 2D Photos Into 3D Scenes in the Blink of an AI</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp\">GitHub | NVIDIA InstantNGP Repo</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/getting-started-with-nvidia-instant-nerfs/\">NVIDIA | Getting Started with NVIDIA Instant NeRFs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3rd Party NeRF Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/\">NeRF Studio</a> + <a href=\"https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/blender_addon.html\">Blender VFX add-on<</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vouz5gYpIw7bUBAGfAvPNcvNQoAfY_E7BhUJOGtV2cw/edit\">Google Docs | Kartaverse Workflows | Creating Volumetric NeRFs</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15nnPfSXPTwNpovGxr_mRZncRoSfjmYqFoh08CHbNVVY/edit\">Google Docs | InstantNGP | Best Practices For Desktop-Based NeRF Workflows</a></li>\n</ul>",

It does order-of-operations, and a few other nifty things that you should really discover for yourself. If  you're into titles, motion graphics, subtitles, lower thirds, text in  general or karaoke, SLWO is a must-have in your tool belt!</p>\n\n<p>After installation, start Fusion, add a <strong>Text+</strong> node, right-click in the text field and select <strong>Suck Less Write On</strong>.

What does it mean, WSL exclusive?</p>\n\n<p>Well, many of you know that WSL and POC have a special bond going on. SecondMan, the Grand-wizard of WSL, has been a great contributor on our Discord channel. I felt that the only way I can contribute to WSL is by promoting the forum through my content.</p>\n\n<p>Watch the special on We Suck Less!<br> <a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=3629\">https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=3629</a></p>\n\n<p>Side note: The non-Fusion bits got longer than I wanted it to be ( you know I always try new things, Lighting, audio, camera, grading etc etc) . I promise the next episode will be more Fusion ( wink at Millolab :)</p>\n\n<p>As always, thank you from the bottom of my heart,</p>\n\n<p>Captain</p>",

You can set up your Left/Right/Top/Bottom boundaries while the image remains in position.</p> \n\n<p>Its usage is hopefully self explanatory: Use the on-screen controls or the screw controls to set the image boundaries and use the Show Result button to apply what you have done. By default your cropped image will retain its position coordinates and resolution but if you want to, you can use the autocrop button, to cut off the parts you longer need. The reset button will restore the image to its original resolution</p> \n\n",

        "Description": "<p>This macro creates a photorealistic glow with an exponential falloff.</p>\n\n<p>A glow is just a blur that is added on top of the input image. Fusion's Glow and SoftGlow tools basically work like that and the result usually doesn't look convincing for strong glows (or in linear color space) so you need to create several blurs and glows with different radii to create a nicer-looking falloff. One technique is to add up blurs with radii that increase exponentially: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and so on. This macro does all the hard work for you.</p>\n\n<p>ExponentialGlow is designed for linear gamma, floating point images that are viewed using a LUT. If you crank it up you might even see banding in float16, so float32 is recommended.</p>\n\n<p>This macro is based on a tool I found that was attributed to one Stuart Lashley. It's also similar to the great Multistep Blur (you would need to set it to a tiny minimum blur and a huge maximum blur with a high bias value to create a similar look). Also, this macro supports DoD and has been optimized to prevent unnecessary re-rendering when gain or tint are adjusted.</p>\n\n<p>VFXPedia &gt; Settings and Macros &gt; ExponentialGlow<br>\nhttps://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index2f2f.html?title=Settings_and_Macros/ExponentialGlow_Description</p>\n\n<p>Pigsfly Forum &gt; Lightswoosh Thread<br>\nhttp://pigsfly.com/index.php?/topic/8208-lightswoosh/?hl=exponentialglow</p>\n",

        "Description": "<p>The Fuses below come from the VFXpedia website and were written or released by employees of Eyeon Software. As examples, they were written to demonstrate, and not necessarily to provide useful functionality (though some do).\n\n\n<p>VFXPedia Page - Eyeon:Script/Reference/Applications/Fuse/Example Fuses:<br>\nhttps://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index8be6.html?title=Eyeon:Script/Reference/Applications/Fuse/Example_Fuses</p>\n\n<h2>Useful Fuses</h2>\n\n<h3>Duplicate.Fuse</h3>\n<p>This Fuse appears in the Fuses/eyeon category. Use this for making copies of layers, with offsets, blend, gain and even jitter. If you find yourself going 3D just to take advantage of the Duplicate 3D tool, this one's for you. If you like Trails but want to netrender, or want more control, you'll probably find this handy too. For bonus points, enable the hidden Time Offset control - but read the note first!</p>\n\n\n<h3>CropRectangle.Fuse</h3>\n<p>This Fuse appears in the Tools/Transform category. It is a variation on the crop tool. It initially presents an uncropped version of the image, with an onscreen rectangle control that represents the cropping region. Selecting the \"Show Crop\" option will output the crop instead, and hides the rectangle control.</p>\n\n<h3>Set_Metadata.Fuse</h3>\n<p>This Fuse appears in the Fuses/eyeon category. Use this fuse to add/insert metadata to an image. The first field is used to define the metadata tag, and the second field the value. Example: Set the tag to Timecode and add a timecode modifier to the second field.</p>\n\n<h2>Coding Examples</h2>\n\n<p>The following examples are not necessarily intended to perform a useful function. Artists who wish to create their own Fuses may find them useful as starting points. Tools in this category will appear under the Fuses category in the Tools menu.</p>\n\n<h3>Null.Fuse</h3>\n<p>About as simple as it gets. This tool doesn't actually do anything - it just passes the input to the output. An example of the bare minimum required to create a tool.</p>\n\n<h3>BoolTest.Fuse</h3>\n<p>An example Fuse which re-implements the min, max, add and subtract functions of the Channel Booleans tool using a multibutton array.</p>\n\n<h3>ClipRange.Fuse</h3>\n<p>An example Fuse which will clamps the high and low ranges values of the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha values of an image using range controls.</p>\n\n<h3>Gain.Fuse</h3>\n<p>An example Fuse which implements a simple Gain. Demonstrates the Slider and Combo control types. Also a good example of the various methods of processing pixels in an image.</p>\n\n<h3>SourceTest.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A Creator or Source type tool. This creates an image full of random noise. A good example of how to create new images</p>\n\n<h3>ShapeTest.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A more detailed example that draws multiple shapes over an image. A good example of drawing, merging and transformation functions.</p>\n\n<h3>ParticleEmitterTest.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A nearly complete reimplementation of the pEmitter tool as a Fuse.</p>\n\n<h3>TextCountdown.Fuse</h3>\n<p>Example of a Text modifier Fuse, with a simple countdown output. To use, modify any text field with Countdown.</p>\n\n<h3>TilePic.Fuse</h3>\n<p>This Fuse demonstrates how to add a tile picture icon to a Fuse tool. Otherwise it is identical to the Null.Fuse above. Full instructions can be found in the REG_Fuse_TilePic Attribute documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clones of Native Tools</h2>\n\n<p>These Fuses are clones of tools already found in Fusion. They are handy starting points for extending and modifying the default functionality, or just to see how the tools work.</p>\n\n<h3>FuseScale.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A reimplementation of the Scale tool as a Fuse. Good example of the Image:Resize() method.</p>\n\n<h3>FuseBlur.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A reimplementation of the Blur tool as a Fuse. Good example of the Image:Blur() method.</p>\n\n<h3>FuseGlow.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A reimplementation of the Glow tool as a Fuse. Good example of the Image:Blur() method.</p>\n\n<h3>FuseMerge.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A reimplementation of the Merge tool as a Fuse. Good example of the Image:Merge() method.</p>\n\n<h3>FuseTransform.Fuse</h3>\n<p>A reimplementation of the Transform tool as a Fuse. Good example of the Image:Transform() method.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>This macro gives Fusion the useful ability to map colours from a gradient to an image, based on the luminance of that image. Other channels may be used, and optionally, Perlin noise can be used to perturb the gradient being applied.</p>\n\n<p>It is based on a Bitmap Mask to extract the luminance of the image. This can be softened, or its levels can be tweaked, or a different source channel can be used (e.g. RGB, hue or saturation). The resulting mask is then given to a FastNoise tool and used to modify the brightness of the Perlin noise it creates. By default, Noise Detail is set to 0 (flat) so no noise is generated, and the image's mask is used directly. FastNoise's various colour gradient controls can then be used to map colours to the mask.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: In some cases, you might want to preserve the luminance of the original image while just replacing the colours. This can be easily done by using bright colours, then using a Channel Booleans tool to multiply the result of the GradientMapper with the Luminance of its source.</p>\n\n<p>VFXPedia Page - Settings and Macros > GradientMapper Description:<br>\nhttps://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index0127.html?title=Settings_and_Macros/GradientMapper_Description</p>",

        "Description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Volumetric Camera Systems is pleased to provide a *free* live-action captured Fusion volumetric 3D scene to explore with KartaVR v4 for Reactor. This example Fusion 9 comp provides a static 3D scene extracted from a live-action full motion 30 FPS volumetric mesh sequence experience that is known internally by VCS staff as \"The Cowgrammetry MOOvie\".</p>\n\n<h2>Volumetric Capture Notes</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <i>The data in this demo has been reduced to 1/150th of its original captured resolution. For example, the barn model has been reduced from a high resolution 10 GB OBJ plygon mesh down to a 64 MB OBJ mesh to make it interactive in Fusion's 3D system, and fast to load on a wide variety of computers.</i></p>\n\n<p>The \"Cowgrammetry.comp\" example has a scan of a old barn at a family run hobby farm located 30 minutes outside of Burnaby, B.C. Canada. This barn is home to Lima (Lee ma) the cow.</p>\n\n<p>The barn was captured by Volumetric Camera Systems using a Leica LIDAR scannner to capture 3 laser scans and merge them into a finished point cloud of the barn envronment. Then the point cloud data was converted to a high resolution polygon mesh. For this Reactor downloadable demo, the barn scene and textures have been deicmated so they are interactive and fun to play with.</p>\n\n<p>Lima the cow was captured by Volumetric Camera Systems' live-action portable \"Multi Planar Grid Array\" videogrammetry scanning system on Aug 2018 as a 30 FPS mesh sequence.</p>\n\n<p>The human character in the cowgrammetry scene is a static mesh exported from a full-body 30 FPS mesh sequence scan of Tobias Chen, the founder of Volumetric Camera Systems. The character scan was captured using a \"Planar Dome Grid Array\" rig back at VCS's head quarters.</p>\n\n<p>With Volumetric Camera Systems technology you can get high quality 30/60 FPS mesh sequences and point clouds from a portable volumetric capture stage that can be shipped anywhere on earth, run off battery power, and set up in half a day. All processing of \"holographic\" volumetric data coming from the portable capture stage rigs is done using a fully automated pipeline via Volumetric Camera Systems' hybrid CPU/GPU based compute cloud.</p>\n\n<h2>3D Model License Terms</h2>\n\n<p>Creative Commons License:<br>\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)</p>\n\n<h3>Dataset Copyright Owner</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Tobias Chen</strong><br>\nVolumetric Camera Systems<br>\nBurnaby, BC, Canada</p>\n\n<p>Email: me@tobiaschen.com<br>\nWeb: http://www.VolumetricCameraSystems.com</p>\n\n",

Data nodes are tools that allow you to interconnect nodes together by supporting more data types for the input and output connections such as numbers, text, spreadsheets, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, metadata, arrays, matrices, and more.</p>\n\n<p>These data node-based techniques encourage a more seamless interchange of information between DCC tools by reducing the loss of important metadata, removing manual data entry steps that can be error-prone, and keep data flowing through a pipeline in a more organized and consistent way.</p>\n\n<p>The long-term hope of Vonk's developers is to help encourage artists and TDs to adopt \"data node\" concepts across a full production pipeline. These approaches are beneficial for teams working on cutting-edge projects in the motion graphics, VFX, XR, computer vision, machine learning, video/photogrammetry, and digital production/VP space.</p>\n\n<p>Vonk's wide range of nodes include the newly added \"vFileSystem\" fuses which make it possible for a comp/pipeline TD to port the conceptual ideas found in a typical pipeline shell-script (.bat/.sh) into a fully node-based \"Visual Shell Scripting'' paradigm that can run cross-platform inside of Resolve/Fusion/Fusion Render Node. This is effective if it's late at night, your brain focus is fading fast, and you need to quickly whip up in 15 minutes or less a general purpose data processing tool to solve an immediate production challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Open-Source License<br>\nThe Vonk fuses are licensed under a GPL v3 license.</p>\n\n<p>Acknowledgements<br>\nThe original Spicy Acorn Vonk toolset was created by<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:xmnr0x23@gmail.com\">Kristof Indeherberge</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:duriau.cedric@live.be\">C&eacute;dric Duriau</a></p>\n\n<p>The Vonk Ultra fork is maintained by:<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com\">Andrew Hazelden</a></p>\n\n<h2>For More Info</h2>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vonkultra/\">Vonk Ultra Instagram channel</a> for inspiration!</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kartaverse.github.io/VonkUltra/\">Vonk Ultra Mograph documentation</a> is accessible on GitHub.</p>\n\nThe original <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9WfdHlE1AZHdU6_ZQCB1I2nSa5I7TyHG2vKMi2I7v8/edit?usp=sharing\">Vonk Ultra documentation</a> is accessible on Google Docs.</p>\n\n<p>Local PDF formatted Vonk documentation can be read on disk at:<br>\n<a href=\"file://Reactor:/Deploy/Docs/Kartaverse/Vonk Ultra/Vonk Ultra Data Nodes.pdf\">Reactor:/Deploy/Docs/Kartaverse/Vonk Ultra/Vonk Ultra Data Nodes.pdf</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to provide feedback on the evolution of the Vonk data nodes, please check out the <a href=\"https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=41165#p41165\">development thread on the Steakunderwater forum</a>.</p>\n",

        "Description": "<p>The <b>CineForm Loader/Saver</b> is a free (as in beer) loader and saver for CineForm compressed DPX files (aka. DPX-C) and CineForm encoded QuickTime movies.</p>\n\n<p>The plugin allows to load and save 10bit YUV 4:2:2, 12bit RGB(A) and 12bit Bayer RAW files (load only) and supports all CineForm compression settings. Additionally it provides view selection (both, left or right) for Stereo 3D CineForm files.<br />\nThe DPX-C format is basically a DPX file containing an 1/8 size thumbnail image as 10bit RGB data. Hidden to normal DPX file readers it contains the CineForm data for the full-size image. Since it is a single-frame format, it can also be used on renderfarms.</p>\n\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>After installing this plugin Fusion will default to the CineForm saver for DPX and QuickTime when you create a new saver and just specify the filename with the corresponding extension. To save to regular DPX or QuickTime files (using Fusion's internal savers) you need to specify that format in the file format list.</i></p>\n\n<p>Latest version, some additional information and other Fusion stuff might be found at:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.cinewrangler.com/blackmagic-fusion-plugins/\">http://www.cinewrangler.com/blackmagic-fusion-plugins/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>License</h3>\n\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, <br />\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES <br />\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND <br />\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size.</p>\n\n<h2>Notepad++ for Fusion Customizations</h2>\n\n<p>This version of Notepad++ has a customized right-click contextual menu system with new menu items, extra plugins added, a UI Manager Lua and Python code snippet library was added, the Dark Mode is enabled with the Obsidian Style, and Resolve/Fusion file format based syntax highlighting modes have been pre-configured.</p>\n\n<p>Included with this atom is a script \"Change Editor Path to Notepad++.lua\" that can be accessed from the \"Script &gt; Reactor &gt; Change Editor Path to Notepad++\". This script changes Fusion's \"Global and Default Settings&gt; Script &gt; Editor Path\" preferences to use the Reactor provided version of Notepad++ as the default script editor. After running this script you can use Fusion's \"Script > Edit > ...\" menu items and Notepad++ will be launched as your code editor.</p>\n\n<p>The Reactor \"Menus &gt; Open in Script Editor\" atom package will be installed automatically as a dependency. It creates a new \"File &gt; Open in Script Editor\" menu entry in Fusion and allows you to quickly tweak your comp externally in a programmer's text editor so you could do raw \"find and replace\" editing operations, or to edit a node as code.</p>\n\n<h2>Fusion Syntax Highlighting</h2>\n\nThe following Fusion centric document formats are automatically syntax highlighted in Notepad++:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>atom</li>\n\t<li>blocklist</li>\n\t<li>comp</li>\n\t<li>cfg</li>\n\t<li>dfq</li>\n\t<li>def</li>\n\t<li>eyeonscript</li>\n\t<li>flt</li>\n\t<li>fu</li>\n\t<li>fuse</li>\n\t<li>guide</li>\n\t<li>library</li>\n\t<li>layout</li>\n\t<li>setting</li>\n\t<li>toolbars</li>\n\t<li>prefs</li>\n\t<li>scriptlib</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>Installed Notepad++ Plugins</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ComparePlugin</li>\n\t<li>CustomizeToolbar</li>\n\t<li>DSpellCheck</li>\n\t<li>Explorer</li>\n\t<li>LuaScript</li>\n\t<li>MenuIcons</li>\n\t<li>mimeTools</li>\n\t<li>NppConverter</li>\n\t<li>NppExport</li>\n\t<li>NPPJSONViewer</li>\n\t<li>NppMarkdownPanel</li>\n\t<li>NppSnippets</li>\n\t<li>NppTextFX</li>\n\t<li>NppToolBucket</li>\n\t<li>PreviewHTML</li>\n\t<li>PythonScript</li>\n\t<li>XMLTools</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>Open Source License:</h2>\n<p>GPL v2</p>\n\n<p>The Notepad++ atom was packaged by <a href=\"mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com\">Andrew Hazelden</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: This atom includes Windows 32-bit build of Notepad++.</p>\n\n\n<h2>For More Information:</h2>\n\n<p>https://notepad-plus-plus.org</p>\n<p>http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=Plugin_Central</p>\n",
